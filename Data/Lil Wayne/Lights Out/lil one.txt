[Intro: Lil' Wayne]
Fuck, man I been on this block all day
(say, say, say, say, say)
Hot man, get off my shirt, hot man
(Oh whatchu got?) Ohhh who that?
Boy that look like Baby, that ain't (that's dubs?)
That ain't Baby (that's dubs?)
That ain't - that is that nigga man (lets go)

[Baby] Say Lil' One
[Wayne] What, what's happening with you big dog?
[Baby] Look I need to talk about some serious shit dog
[Wayne] Like what? Look I ain't have nothing to do with
Killing them...
[Baby] Slow down, I'm talking bout some getting money shit
And how its gonna go down
[Wayne] Well holla at me nigga, talk to me, let me know something
Cause right now I'm tired of hustling
And these rocks ain't doing nothing
And to tell you the truth I feel like I be out here for the fun of it
I swear if I don't hit a lick by next month, I'm done with it
[Baby] Understand, but you ain't listening you just talking
I said I could get you paid, is you with that offer?
I know you see me coming through everyday pimpin
In a Benz, the Jag, and a Ferrari
[Wayne] Yeah, but I like that Bentley
[Baby] All thats cool shorty, you can get this if you with me
Let me run it down to you bout this shit that I've been getting in
[Wayne] I mean, I'm saying, it sound good, I like that
[Baby] What thats a blunt?

[Wayne] Aight cat, just don't be playing, this worth my while?
[Baby] Lil' daddy I play with hoes, is you a ho?
[Wayne] Nah
[Baby] Say I got work, I need to flood it all over
I can't do it by myself, so I need me a lil' solider
I been peeping ya lil' ass, I see you grinding and shit
[Wayne] I been peeping you too, nigga I see you shining and shit
And you don't even know how long I been trying to find me a brick
To make it flip and take the chips and go an buy me a whip
[Baby] Fuck a whip, that could wait
You worry bout your cake
Once you make enough to play, go buy a Z-28
[Wayne] A Z-28, boy go head, once I get change
I'mma go an cop me a Range and two platinum chains
[Baby] Well look I ain't fucking with you
You too young from the start
[Wayne] Man that ain't even got anything to do with it
Its dedication and heart
[Baby] Dedication and smarts
Don't put your heart in this game
Cause when you fall to deep in love you get caught in this game
[Wayne] Well correct me when I'm wrong
And acknowlegde me when I'm right
[Baby] Lil' bitch, if your hard head ass listen I might
[Wayne] B, I'm all ears
[Baby] Get your ass in this car
[Wayne] Unlock the door
[Baby] Its unlocked
[Wayne] Don't holla at me
You ain't my pa
[Baby] Now stop playing, look I got a hundred bricks just came
Fifty ki's of raw dope, and fifty bricks of cocaine
Pays five a piece
[Wayne] Every week?
[Baby] Just move it together
I'mma knock off my lil' section
You take care of your area
[Wayne] Ughhh, nigga I been waiting to be the Don 'round here

But how you want me to sell this

[Baby] However they ask for it, just give it to them Lil' Wheez
[Wayne] I'm all for it cousin

If power get between it I'mma split me a nigga
[Baby] You better, but when I get you this shit nigga

Whispering something you can't understand*}

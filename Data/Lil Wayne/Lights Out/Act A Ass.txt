[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass with it
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass with it
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass with it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You know them hoes love Weezy, say he cute, small, long hair, big dick
Weezy bring to y'all, don't y'all lip quit
Put your lips on this dick, let me get on some livin'
Spit all over ya chin, Weezy be on some pimp shit
I see 'em, peep 'em, meet 'em, beep 'em, later on if she ride
G 'em, freak 'em, by the weekend she be fuckin' the squad
I ain't got no loves for broads, I ducks and dodge
I grab 'em on their butts and all
She fucks my dog, slut sucks nuts and all, and nothin' small
This dick make 'em hit the floor and touch the wall
Call my hoes defensive linemen, cause they rush the balls
Let Weezy bust they jaws (blurrrpp)
Never have no picks and chooses, I hits and lose 'em
And go to the hotel and switch for ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fire, project girl to thug with me
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck wit me

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, B.G & Both]
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start buggin and
And bungee jumpin'
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

[Verse 2: B.G]
That's right, act a fool bitch, do what you do, ho
After I finish, don't get up, gotta let Weezy go
You get your props your pussy fire, girl you a pro
So when I'm speakin' I'm creepin' and come get some mo'
You better recognize, you better realize
This is the nigga Geezy, I ain't nothin' nice
Love when you reach out, grab, stuff it straight your mouth
Start suckin 'til that middle come out
Ride me (ride me), put that dick inside you (inside you)
After that wiggle your ass gimmie that loose-loose
I'm a donkey, better yet a veteran
At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
The Number 1 Stunna, Baby he raised me
Pumped in my head - never let a bitch play me
Always get the clique, make you fuck 'em all
Wrap a chain 'round ya neck and walk it like a dog

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, B.G & Both]
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start buggin and
And bungee jumpin'
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
See me, Lil Wayne I put that dick down, biznites can't even walk, can't even sit down
Wipe your mouth off and let me hit now
That Rum got me feelin' real good
The dick hard like real wood
I put it in slow and work it real good
This Lil nigga have a lot a sex, so do me slow, get out the Prada dress
I Come when you wanted to like private jets
I'm on blast ma', why you take it slower than its fast time
Flip ya back over, make that ass right
Weezy make ya suck it then taste, that's how the pimp play
Make her friend eat me and this bitch up like shrimp plates
Bouncing in the club rollin' on X, eyes pitch black
I got 2 more 'nites is you wit that
Fuck it let's go, we pop a bottle of the Moe'
Drop the top part of the 'Dro
Later on I'm touchin' the throat, bad wit it
Where them hot girls that like that nasty shit
Make them act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, B.G & Both]
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start buggin and
And bungee jumpin'
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

[Intro]
Biznite.Biznite..Nothing but it

[Verse 1]
I'm dippin' in a black milleny benny sittin on twentys
Top off when the city's windy me and pretty Cindy
She dressed up in pretty Fendi and she sippin remy
I'm Iceburg nothin but Whinnie all the way to my tennie
I'm hotter than a semi' cause this skirt shes wearing mini
And plus my head is spinnin from drinkin this fifth of Henny
I stop at any deli cause this freakin with her penny
And ain't no tellin how many she 'umm already been in
We get inside the room and she gigglin plain grinnin
Slowly the lights dimmin and I'm slippin on my jimmy
I'm feelin with her titties this is only the beginnin
I stick it in her kitty now she screamin come on gimme
I'm flippin this chick over and I caught her slowly bendin
I'm hittin got her twistin this is my ninny you hear me
And when its time to quit I got her soakin wet and drippin
She asked me for a kiss ah..

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I ride up in a Porsche Boxter see this fox her name was Tasha
I got her when I stopped her at McDonalds with her partner
I jocked the way she rocked her lil Versasce and her Prada
I'm Iceburg or Bahama from bottom to collar
I jot her my phone number later on gave me a holla
I popped up by her mamas so her nigga won't know nada
She took thirty minutes play me like a some kinda coward
Now hopped up in my car and started talkin bout her doctor
She said she started ridin it in her babys fathers Honda
She wish that he would trade it in and cop a brand new Mazda
I'm drivin to the label to the back and put the top up
I roll down all the windows put the car in function "watch the"
I tried to touch her thigh she moved my hand and said ah ah bro
It took five minutes to bang then you know she propper
I'm knockin out her brains
We got the car shakin' and rocklin'
She asked me for a kiss ah

[Chorus]
Biznite whats your problem
Wha..
Biznite whats your problem
Wha..
Biznite whats your problem
Wha
Biznite whats your problem
Wha
You nothin but a sack chasin cock tastin biznite
Your never gonna amount to anythin but a biznite
'cuz all I wanna do is hit it raw I don't even wanna talk
If your baby come born with braids I ain't the pa
Nope I ain't the pa
Hell no I ain't the pa
No I ain't the pa
Hell no I ain't the pa

[Verse 3]
There was this stupid name was Lucy came up to me at the movies
Said she just saw Balla Blockin and thought that I was cute
And but you and baby too can still come over early Tuesday
I just bought a new mansion just finished it and my movie
I knew she was a new from head to shoulder check this Gucci
And me I'm Iceberg Tom and Jerry, Daffy and Goofy
She say "oo" it would be so nice and usually she would do it
But lately she been spooked her boo just come from institution
I say that's cool cuz I don't really wanna have to shoot him
I gave the braud the pager number and said that she should use it
As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six
She beeped and left a message that she come up with a solution
I scootin a run through straight to my house I won't be foolish
She had no bathin suit and then want me to see her booty
I oozed it in her coochie when she got in my Jacuzzi
She asked me for a kiss ah

[Chorus]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
We had them bitches addicted like it was some drug
Its Weezy Wee, Mannie Fresh, and Unplugged
We had them bitches addicted like it was some drug
Weezy, Fresh, and Unplugged

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress, one who put them lips in effect
Suck the dick until the shit in her chest
You can piss on her breast, I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish big and sweet ho, black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, specializin in givin me deep throat
Really don't care how (?) shorty
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum, don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girls I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it, it's off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban ho, with a fat ass though
Bet I'll treat the bitch just like Fidel Castro

[Chorus: UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Listen, listen, it's Weezy the hottest, drinkin Barcadis
I stream through the scene in a Lincoln on Robbers
Lookin for the finest dime to wine and dine
Later on I'm tryin to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down
Pick ya up, dick up in ya, throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around, and scream my name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame, better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on de plastic, make ya bounce like elastic
Put the pickle in the middle, make it wiggle for y'all
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, fat ass and shit
Like sassy, flip like Trina, "Da Baddest Bitch"
Matter of fact when I see her, +Pull+ her +Over+ like a cop
Juvey coulda "Backed It Up" and I'da "Dropped it Like It's Hot"
Ya heard me?! (What, haha)
Haha, Unplugged

[Chorus: UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
I like them big and round, pretty and brown
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce slide drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it get a nut, get a nut
Shake for ya hood, bounce for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, hold up, pause
My bitch got thongs, yo' bitch got drawers
My chick like to swallow, yo' chick like to spit
If yo' chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, wait a minute, chill out, stop
My ginseng, viagra, and a strawberry pop
See I'm gettin kinda bold, won't ya bring a friend
From vagina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout delta
Yo mama loved a Tymer but now you welcome
You ok lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love my dick

[Chorus: UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

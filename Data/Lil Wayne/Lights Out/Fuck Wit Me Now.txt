[Intro]
Let's go - let's go
Let's go - let's go
They can't fuck with me now
Huh? Fuck with me now
No, they can't fuck with me now
Can't fuck with me now
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I go by Weezy The Don
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, freezin' the arm
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck are them killas with the money nigga
We be the squad. It's so serious like
It's like ain't nothin' but 10 hot shellys
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothin' sweet cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look up out the window, see the man and his dawgs
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your abdomen’s gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' with me get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

[Verse 2]
Iceberg Shorty dammit, pants is saggin', forty magnum
Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'
Tinted up Ferrari wagon, braggin'
Ohh, what's happenin'?
(??) 'round the court cause some ex just looked at me
Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eats on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Come on!

[Verse 3]
It's too dark for ya's
I ain't got no love for ya's
Let gunshots smoked ya's
Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kiddin' – me awake, DOA
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that ho shit
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:
I cause fatalities for any technicality
Wipe off your family randomly - U Understand?
It ain't a motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'
Come on!

[Chorus]
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now
Look-
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - no, they can't fuck with me now

[Outro]
Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga
Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga
Wha, wha, uh, uh, nigga!
Wheezy Whee!!! (Whee! Whee! Whee!)
Watch out! (Watch out!)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg? I'm on some, some adult grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Jeezy, Juvie, Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Age is nothing but some digits, nigga trust me on this
Cause I think I speak for everyone when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L, gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
But in the mean while I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up, but I smoke bout 3 blunts
And puff a cooler boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff, but I be like

[Chorus]
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like

[Chorus]
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like

[Chorus]
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

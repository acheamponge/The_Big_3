[Intro]
It was the summer of 2001
And I saw the whole fuckin' thing
Wait, can I say fuck on TV? Fuck it!
These guys had on some squad, shit!
It was Lil Wayne, two adults, puppies, six children, and one fluffy puppy, and a dike
But not that kind of dyke, Dick Van Dike
Hey, can I give a few shoutouts to my people?
Yo mom! Yo dad! What's up? How's everybody doing? Cool! I'm on TV!
Hey, I been tellin' them guys they gotta get off the corner!
(I mean y'all know I'm good for it...)

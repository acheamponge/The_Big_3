[Intro]
Look look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look

[Verse 1]
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust bang!
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Weezy Wee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'mma hit the block and borrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

[Verse 2]
What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

[Verse 3]
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Weezy kill 'em all easy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

[Chorus]
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run

[Outro]
Niggas bet' not play with me
Look, uh-huh (uh-huh uh-huh)
Look look look
Look look look
Whoa

[Hook: Jake Troth]
When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us
Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea, on
I'm racing on, yea
My heart races on

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die
The angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, Momma hate I got my Daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my Daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized

[Hook: Jake Troth & (Lil Wayne)]
When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yea (I'm gone)
My heart races on

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

[Hook: Jake Troth & (Lil Wayne)]
When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas (Errrr)
Burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
(My heart right and my head ain't)
I'm racing on, yea (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yea
(There’s nothing left but to fly high
If you catch a feather just keep it)
My heart races on

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line – On your mark, set, pow

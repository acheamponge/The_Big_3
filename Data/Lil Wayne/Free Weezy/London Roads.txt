[Intro]
Weed and syrup, yeah
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 1]
All I know is paper
I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap
And pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon
It's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy
Keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind
And bodies on my nine
And I swear everyday
I'm on my Ariana grind
De
I got that yay
I got that ladidadida
And a kamikaze squad
And you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man
Like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove
Turnin' O's
To octagons
I get money while I'm sleep
I dream that I'm in heaven
I dreamed I saw Lil Beezy
And smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, Rest In Peace
And my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep
They catch him
When he least expect 'em
Momma told me
"If you run these streets
Run these streets correctly"
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows
I wear new clothes
To the mall
Two hoes
On my arm
Fur boots
When it's warm
Church shoes
To play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper
I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you
Neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him
Better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy, 'cause they done sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zero's
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper
Big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is
That bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience
'Til I heard all aboard
They mad cause I be skatin'
At home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5k
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London
Y'all don't hear me

[Interlude]
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 2]
Hol' up
Had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up
Roll some more up
Watch me go up
My doors go up
When I show up
Why you show up?
Pick my bro up
Pick a O up
Hit the store up
Get a soda
Get us 4 cups
Split a 4 up
Then we slow up
Yeah you know us
Then we toast cups
And we post up
Don't approach us
We got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust
Give no fucks
Take no stuff
And take your stuff
Then ho hunt
For some chocha
I know a ho
Who'll rock the boat
But I row her
I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita
I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres
Oh Lord
I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms
He died recent
So I hope heaven made more room for him
And I hope he see me
Cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy
Oh Lord

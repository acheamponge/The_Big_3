First degree murder
Beg them, no push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
He youths, them strapped with them burner

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Real niggas say soowoo
And such and such killed such and such
The streets talk
And bullshit walks
On crutches, but
It's strut to strut
Niggas panic
Button pressing
The end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time
Where the ten commandments
Are now suggestions
How depressing
How infested
Click-clack, pow; intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses
With tight pussies, I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears
So keep it acapella
Based on a true story
We not worried, y'all too worried
I faced my fears
And told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous
Dread head from New Orleans
Where the youth, them got two choices
Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you
We murdered them

[Hook: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg them no push it further
This a nuh beef we make burger
The youths them strapped with them burner
First degree murder
Beg them no push it further
This a nuh beef we make burger
Cus the youths them strapped with them burner

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Yo, Tune point and I'm dusting niggas
I ain't talking lacing no marijuana
Soon as I hatch I reign like a quail
And I don't give 2 fucks I ain't a koala
My uncle gangsta but I make him nervous
All he see in my face is murda
Waste a burna is my waste a furnace
I'm pacing turners your face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga wake up on the wake up
Lay down and a model bitch ache up
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough taped off of this day pub
Race off like some motherfucking make up
Take off looking for something to take up
Want the paper? Or you want in the paper?
Not horoscopes but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga 30 for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much you sneezing dick
Believe in me I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money till I'm in the freezer stiff
Bitch

[Hook: Junior Reid]
First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
The youths dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
Cus the youths dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 3: Capo]
It's all about the money nigga fuck the fame
Where we come from shots ring nigga broad day
Lil woadie said he had the chance he do the shit again
Pop the pills for the pain but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rapper man the back soaking gang
Cartier frames got them looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard in the rally same?
Lowkey can still get a brick off my name
Now I'mma tell you this here for my youngin and them
The same ones I help the corners with do numbers with
If there ever was a problem watch them pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script you know I switched
We now switch

[Hook: Junior Reid]
First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
The youths dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murda
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef weh make burga
Cus the youths dem strapped with dem burner

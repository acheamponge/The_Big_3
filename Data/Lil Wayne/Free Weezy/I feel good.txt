[Intro]
Tunechi
Baby
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Lord I think I'm ballin' too hard
And my girlfriend think she too much
All she do is get pretty, I get shitfaced
Don't we make a cute couple?
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks
I got a posse full of hitters
And a pocket full of "In God We Trust"
It's been so long since I said "It cost too much"
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle
And withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal
But I know you see money's not a problem
Bal' like a butch bitch
Let's go on a shopping spree, take that shit to Goodwill
Money in a shoebox, what's up with all these shoeboxes?
Baby, I'm my own boss, "Dwayne, you gon' get you fired!"

[Hook]
But I feel good, woo
I knew that I would, yeah
I feel good, yeah
I'm smoking that good, yeah
I feel good, yeah
My girl got that good, yeah
Girl your pussy so good
And these hoes is no good
But I got you, yeah
Girl your pussy so good (so good)
And these hoes is no good (no good)
But I got you, yeah
I got you, wooo

[Verse 2]
Woo, Tunechi, baby, yeah
They say "Boy put some money aside"
Don't tell me what to do with mine
All my kids already rich, and they kids, and they kids...
They think money grow on trees
And as tall as they grew, I climbed
Knock-knock "Who's there?" Hah!
I told the bitch "It's just money"
The road can get a lil bumpy
So, on the low, I got that blow
And ya nose gon' feel like a trumpet
I'm goin home to my lil mama, she call me Big Poppa
She get hard dick and McDonald's
Cause she so tired of them Whoppers
I fuck her good, so proper, she say my name in Opera
I turn into a Piranha, then eat it like Tilapia
She know I'm going through a lot
So she say my name in Gospel
No weapon formed against Weezy shall prosper

[Hook]
And I feel good, yeah
I knew that I would, yeah
And I'm still hood, yeah
Shoutout to my hood
I was sick of stuntin' but I feel cured
Leave yo ass in the woods, yeah
And these hoes is no good, no good
But I got a few, yeah
These hoes is no good (no good)
These hoes is no good (no good)
But, fuck it, I got you, ah
Fuck 'em I got you, ah

[Outro]
And I feel good
Tunechi, baby (Hey!)
I feel good, yeah
Woo! Like diamonds on wood
Woo, mmm, ow! yeah
I feel good, yeah
My girl got that good, yeah
Girl, your pussy so good
And these hoes is no good
But I got you, yeah
(Woaw!)

[Verse 1]
Uhh
Hundred thousand on a small-ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than Ms
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant's clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?
Put it on my tab, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this

[Hook]
Now tell them motherfuckers, I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden, I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden, I'm

[Bridge]
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'mma honk the horn, ridin' passed the penitentiary
And I'mma drive slow, ridin' passed the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"

[Verse 2]
One time
For the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential said it's crunch time
Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it
I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce
When I walk out the pen

[Hook]
My nigga I'm, I'm post-bail ballin, post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm, I'm post-bail ballin'
Post-bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm, I'm post-bail ballin'
Farewell warden, I'm post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm post-bail ballin'
Inmate Carter: Post-bail ballin'

[Outro]
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'mma honk the horn ridin' past the penitentiary
And I'mma drive slow ridin' past the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley

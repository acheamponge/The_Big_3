'Cause this AR will not allow me to walk straight
I've come to a stage in my life
And I just can't let my life boo me off stage, no
Tuxedo on and a cumberbund
Fingers crossed behind my back
On the corner watching my money come

[Outro]
I wear black 'cause I can't find nothing else to wear
I wear dreadlocks 'cause I can't do nothing else to my hair
I kiss you 'cause it just happen
I do what I do 'cause it got to be done
But I guess I ought to start taking credit for something, right

Yesterday I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there
She wasn't there again today
I really hope she go away
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't want to do it no more)
Cause you know, sometimes "at last" doesn't happen at first
I'm the pimp and the problem
She said "You don't think of me when I know you think too much"
(I don't want to do it no more
These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody
And I don't want to do it no more)
She said "I think you think I think you think of us"
(I'mma get this paper baby, I'mma get this paper baby)
She said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners

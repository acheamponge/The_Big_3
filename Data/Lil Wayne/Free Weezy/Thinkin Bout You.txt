[Intro]
Uhh, Uhh, I was chilling on the set
With the fully-automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Uhh, bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
I say bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
But I got one I really fuck with
She makes my heart skip a beat
She dropped her drum stick
Sometimes we fuck forever, sometimes I cum quick
I eat that pussy 'cause it's sweet, as sweet as one-six
Sixteen bullets in a clip, but more than one clip
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced
I got strawberry cocaine as sweet as Fun Dip
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch
I love my young bitch
'Cause she don't give me drama
You don't want no drama
My goons waitin' for you, to snap
Like some photo bombers
Yeah we leave a nigga flat
We leave 'em horizontal
And then my lawyer tell your honor
On that morning, I was –

[Chorus]
Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you girl
Yeah, I was chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
It go U-N-L-V
It go, it go U-N-L-V
It go U-N-L-V, U-N-L-V
Uptown Nigga Living Violent
Do I smell beef?

[Verse 2]
I was chilling on the corner about to get fucked up
My nigga T got a 40, and he brought two cups
That nigga Mack was chillin', Po was home talkin' on the phone
Lord, it's been such a good-year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hoody on the set, he got his hoodie on
Euro the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong, chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord, I know I do my thing, can’t let my thing do me
Lord, I know I ain’t a Saint, still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord, just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree, this murder in the first degree
I got that Tec under my arm like Right Guard, Sure, Degree
Lord, sometimes I just be so gone I be like "Earth to me?"
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I served a fiend
While I was

[Chorus]
Chilling on the set
With a fully automatic Tec
I was thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you girl
Yeah I was chilling on the set
With a fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you, girl

[Outro]
Yeah
Thinking 'bout you girl
Working my juug girl
Still thinking 'bout you girl
Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
Working my juug girl
I was still thinking 'bout you

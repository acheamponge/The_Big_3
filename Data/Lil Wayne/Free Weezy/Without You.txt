[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
I done spent so many of my days without you (Yeah)
I done lost all my love and found my way without you
I done gave up my soul, and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart, and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
How you doin'?
Me, I'm a mess
I feel powerless
Hands around this bottleneck, mmh
You got a new one
I'm not impressed
And if he trying to flex
You can give him my address, yeah
I be trying to rest
But Lord, the Devil busy
And when I do, I dream of you
And then the Devil pinch me
Do you ever miss me?
Do you ever wish we
Get it right and the rest is history?
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my lack of time
'Cause back then I had to grind
But see, you thought Iâ€™d rather grind
You thought I had the time
Thought I was lying half the time
And now I fantasize and agonize
To pass the time
Lord

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
I done spent so many of my days without you (Uh)
I done lost all my love and found my way without you (Yeah)
I done gave up my soul (Yeah)
And gave up my pride (Yeah)
And taped up my heart (Yeah)
And wiped off my eyes
Without you (Without you)
Without you (Without you)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
How you doin'?
I can tell
You look like yourself
And I look like I'm by myself, fuck
But I'm getting through it
I might as well
'Cause I know time will tell
But it be moving like a snail, yeah
You got a new one
I wish you well
Then I bite my nails
I'm scared I might hear wedding bells, uh
I guess I blew it
It never fails
You was tired of waiting to exhale
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my frame of mind
Back when everything was fine
And we would never think of dying
And I was yours and you was mine
And we combine and intertwine
And now we in decline
Finish line
End of time, Lord
Woo

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
I done spent so many
(I done spent so many, way too many)
Of my days without you
(Of my days without you)
I done lost all my love
(Lost all my love)
And found my way without you (Lord)
I done gave up my soul (Yeah)
And gave up my pride (Yeah)
Taped up my heart (Yeah)
And wiped off my eyes
Without you (Without you)
Without you (Without you)
Yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Now you've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong?
I'm left to live life alone
I'ma need more Styrofoams
If you find your way home
You know that porch light is on
I lay in bed wishing your side was warm
We wish we could go back in time
And push it in reverse
Cause this shit ain't for us
Baby, this shit for the birds
But I know what I'll do
I'll move on, I got to
And this is to you, for you
About you, without you, girl

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
(I done spent so many, way too many
Of my days without you
I done lost all my love, Lord)
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
How you doing? I can tell, yeah
How you doing? I can tell
You look like yourself
I'm by myself

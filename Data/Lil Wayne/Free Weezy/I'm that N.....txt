[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Crazy 'bout my money, pay me by the hundreds
I'm waitin', count it for me, I got all day nigga I ain't rushin'
Overpaid, fuck a budget, I'm overdue, I ain't budgin'
I want my bread, fuck the muffins
Without my cream I'm sour onion
I pour codeine in a LeBron Sprite
Pop a Percocet, I feel like Iron Mike
Strip club, I make 30K, skydive
I get head on a high-rise
My life awesome
I thank God momma didn't have an abortion
So every time I get paid she get a portion
I made a fortune
I'm havin' foursomes
Donâ€™t have to force 'em

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cause I'm that nigga, that nigga nigga, that nigga nigga
I'm that nigga, that nigga nigga, that nigga nigga
Fuck these niggas, these niggas niggas, I ain't these niggas
Fuck these niggas, on second thought baby don't fuck these niggas
I'm that nigga you love, I'm that nigga you love
I'm that nigga you love, I'm that nigga you love
You love to hate, you love to hate
You love to hate, hey, hey

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Goin' berserk, I been whippin' the work
Grimy as fuck, I sell a brick in the church
Now baby pass me my Hammer, go bail my bro out the slammer
Soon as I pour up this Fanta, I'm kickin' ass in Atlanta
I'm in L.A. with some women, I'm in Miami with hoes
Go overseas with my woes, merci beaucoup I suppose
My ho on the globe, I'm pourin' the 4
They got coke on the table, they got dope on the floor
You're really reading me wrong, phone roamin' in Rome
It's like I set it in stone, we blowin' blunts of the strong
My safe like steak, I'm tryin' to filet mignon
What's left to say, I say we kill 'em and gone

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cause I'm that nigga, that nigga nigga, that nigga nigga
I'm that nigga, that nigga nigga, that nigga nigga
Fuck these niggas, these niggas niggas, I ain't these niggas
Fuck these niggas, on second thought baby don't fuck these niggas
I'm that nigga you love, I'm that nigga you love
I'm that nigga you love, I'm that nigga you love
You love to hate, you love to hate
You love to hate, hey, hey..

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Crazy 'bout my money
Psycho 'bout my money
Spiteful 'bout my money
(Bow!) Snipe about my money
Yeah, kill you behind my money
I really need a lot of money (Yep)
My bitch like nice things, and my children grew out them Huggies
Yeah, I pour codeine in a Jones soda
Pop a Percocet, I feel like Balboa
Roger that, 10-4, pssh, man over
These sluts is on my nuts, I feel like granola
Oh, I pass time like a Backwood
I gets high off that good, but I land good
I'm flat-foot but dance good and kick ass good
These niggas can't hold me, I'm a handful

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the nigga nigga
I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, the nigga nigga
Fuck these niggas, these niggas niggas, I ain't these niggas
Fuck these niggas, these niggas niggas, girl fuck these niggas
I'm the nigga you love, I'm the nigga you love
I'm the nigga you love, I'm the nigga you love
You love to hate, you love to hate
You love to hate, hey, hey

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga
Because I'm the nigga, the nigga
Because I'm the nigga, girl fuck these, girl fuck these niggas
On second thought baby don't fuck these niggas
Pullin' triggers, my home up diggers, don't try me nigga
Pullin' triggers, my come up figures, don't try me nigga
I'm that nigga, that nigga that nigga, I'm not them niggas
I'm that nigga, that nigga that nigga, I'm the nigga, yeah

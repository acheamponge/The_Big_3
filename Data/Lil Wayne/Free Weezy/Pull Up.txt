[Intro: Lil Wayne]
That's how I raised 'em, Lord
Them niggas crazy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
D-boy, D-boy, D-boy, my pockets look Keloid
My dead Presidents reborn
When I'm naked I got three arms
Got a big house with a green lawn, got a cigar full of neon
Like my ho cold and my tea warm
Close his casket, he look deformed
I got bitches on my dick

[Verse 2: Euro]
I got Jays at my door
I got shooters on my team
I got Feds down my throat
Counting money, dirty and clean
Smoking nothing but Irene
Got a bitch with good hygiene
I'm sick with it, no vaccine

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got coke under my nails
I got niggas taking them Ls
Nigga, we don't need no scale
I'm sick with it, no get well
Trigga man, trigga man, trigga man please don't shoot
'Bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it like T-R-U
Young nigga ridin' in a V-1-2
Chop bricks like karate, judo, kung fu
Like jiu-jitsu, split a brick in two

[Verse 4: Euro]
You do you, I'mma do what it do
Niggas dropping dimes and their 2 cents too
Bout it, bout it, bout it like hoody-hoo
Started from the bottom and I grew into
Everything I'm driving is new, improved
When she fucking with me it's a new experience
Fucking with you it's a new excuse

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Nigga, who is you?
I looked in the mirror, say "Ooh, it's you"
All my goons be too enthused
So don't open your mouth, like you're chewing glue
Light blue Michael Jordans
My shoe get checks like "Swoosh"
Hear you niggas talking about what you gon' do
Or might do, I invite you, I entice you but I advise you
Not to, God bless you like "Achoo"
Police find you in the bayou
With your friends by you
And your shit knocked loose
Nigga, that's what you'll get like Ken and Ryu
I been Piru, I'm in my mood
So you know what you can do?

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up!
I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga, good luck, yeah
I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga, pull up

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga pull up, fuck nigga pull up
I'll be waiting with my muhfuckin' foot up
I ain't even stood up, fuck nigga, good luck
Fuck nigga put up or muhfuckin' shush up
Fuck nigga, pull up, my young niggas stood up
Like, fuck nigga, what up? Fuck nigga shook up
I been out here since P had the hook up
So if you wan' meet, nigga, I'm a butcher
If you wan' beef, nigga, I'm a butcher
My niggas wanna eat? Nigga, I'mma cook ya
If you with your bitch, and your bitch want me
Nigga, I'mma pull her like a trigger, she the bullet
We the illest, we the coolest (We the illest, we the coolest)
We the illest, we the coolest (We the illest, we the coolest)
The sickest and the smoothest, the gifted and the goofiest
Read a scripture out your movie, get a picture, I'm a-zoomin
I'mma hit 'em, I'mma lose 'em, I'mma kill 'em, I'mma bruise 'em
I'm a sinner, I'm a suitor, not to mention I'm a mover
I come at you when I'm movin', the bitch I'm with bad
I'mma pinch her on her booty, that bitch is Lil Tunechi's
Aw yeah, aw yeah, fuckin' right

[Verse 7: Euro & Lil Wayne]
Always had my gun in fights
Always had the upper hand
You the always-call-your-brother type (ooh)
Hard-head all my fuckin life (yeah)
Whole world in my fuckin hand (yeah)
Damn, my girl just pulled up
With "Pull Up to My Bumper" playin'
But fuck it man, like what you sayin'?
Look, I'm not sayin', but I'm just sayin'

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up
I'll be waitin'
Lord knows, I'll be waitin' for you
Me and my young niggas
That's how I raised 'em

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up, my young niggas stood up
Like, fuck nigga, what up? Blooka-blooka-blookah
I say, fuck nigga, pull up, I'm waitin' with my foot up
Fuck nigga, good luck! Blrrt, blrrt, blrrt!

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne & Euro]
I say, fuck nigga, pull up, fuck around and never pull off
They see the guns we pull out, say "Never mind" and pull off
They see the guns we pull out, say, "Never mind" and keep goin'
I put the gun in his mouth and say "Be quiet and breath soft"
Shifty eyes, I see four, flip them pies like D. Dawes
These bitches tired, they sleepwalk, brilliant mind, I'm street smart
In deep thought and we are what she want and she want
And he don't, but keep on and we gon' see
Yeah!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up
Yeah, fuck nigga, pull up, woo
I'll be waiting, haha
Why you waiting?
Fuck nigga, pull up, fuck nigga, pull up
Fuck nigga, pull up
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you
Uh, me and my young niggas

That's how I raised 'em Lord
Them lil niggas crazy
They just waiting for me to tell 'em to go crazy, boy
What am I waiting for?

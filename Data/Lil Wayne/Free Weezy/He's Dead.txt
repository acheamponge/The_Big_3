[Intro: Sample]
Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It was worse than dead, his brain is gone

(Kane is in the building, nigga)

[Hook]
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I never see your crazy face (Mula)
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name

[Post-Hook]
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead

[Verse 1]
Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd

[Bridge 1]
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no

[Hook]
I never see your crazy face
(You don't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face
(You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)

[Post-Hook]
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead

[Verse 2]
Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin' like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy

[Bridge 2]
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin', Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

[Hook]
(No) I never see your crazy face (Ohhh)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that

[Outro: Sample]
Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is gone

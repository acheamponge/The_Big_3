[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
The loser, microphone abuser
Feet hurtin', I just walked from Jerusalem
So you should get on the side with the movement
I'm the proof and I'll die just to prove it
Whatchu wanna know? Anything, whatever
I can't tell you, I can show you better
Me-me and my gun, we took an oath together
Said I will never die, if we both together
Yeah, this is my testification
I'm Wayne on their hands like precipitation
And in hell you, you need justification
But, but for me it was just a vacation
Heheh, yeah

[Chorus: Shanell]
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

[Verse 2: Shanell]
I lost all my money
I lost half my mind
Can't find my direction
Where's the finish line?
Could I be far away from it all?
How far it gone
If I can stay for it all
Then I shouldn't fall

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Shanell]
Uhh, but if I fall, I fall up and let the clouds hug me
And if I fall down, I bet I hit the ground runnin'
Bet you search and found nothin', looking for the finish line
Stop short cuttin', you fuckin' up your finish time
Shit, but every twice in a while
It feels like I'm runnin', and life is the miles
Yeah, but until the lights dimmin down
I'll be runnin' around, runnin', runnin'
Ohh, ohh-whoa, will you tell me?

[Chorus: Shanell]
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

[Verse 4: Shanell & Lil Wayne]
Counting all my pennies but it doesn't add up
At the mercy but somehow it ain't enough
Reading all the red lights trying not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last, ohh
It's almost over now
I say it's almost over now
The end is gettin' closer now
Better do what you suppose to cause the world is all so short now

[Chorus: Shanell]
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

[Outro: Shanell & Lil Wayne]
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end?
Runnin', run it all!
Yeah! I'm runnin' outta time, I'm runnin' out of space
Feel like I'm runnin' round, but I'm runnin' in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?

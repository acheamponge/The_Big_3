[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Back the hell off!
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin' to feel on
Rollin' like a motherfucker, put your wheels on
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone
I started on the block but that's somethin, to build on
And how can I pray when I got nuttin' to kneel on?

[Chorus]
Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down 'cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

[Verse 2]
Huh, walk on air
Show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain't high enough, au contraire
And sometimes life just don't compare
Sa-say my name, baby, pull my hair
And I'ma fuck you like a bull, I swear
I got a lot of love that I could just share
I got a lot of drugs that I could just share
I-I-I know, I know, what'chu like girl
A nice little mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float...

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

[Chorus]
Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the

[Verse 3]
Hey, I know a girl named Crystal, her last name Ball
I look into her eyes, and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
'Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill-kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin' what am I, be in spiritual fall
Huh, shit, 'cause ain't no love
Die while America drink yo' blood
It ain't no hurricane, it ain't no flood
It's some other shit that we ain't know of
Make that money, yeah, make that money
Then watch the government take that money
But we gon' raise hell, motherfucker get well
Laws get passed and economies fail
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion
Addiction, diction, virgins, dickses
Minglin', mixin', swingin', switchin'
Swaggin', sweet, freaks, faggots
Flames, fashion, planes, crashin'
Ground, zero...

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

[Chorus]
Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

[Outro]
Let's let's let's jump off a buildin' baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a buildin' baby

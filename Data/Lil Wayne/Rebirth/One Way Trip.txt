[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Beat the beat up 'til the beat get punchdrunk
Drown in my flow motherfucker bring your swimmin' trunks
Everybody say they just do it, well I just don't
Times do change motherfucker but the gun don't
Woke up this morning with my dick to the ceilin'
Fell asleep with another chick from my buildin'
Kick her ass out and have breakfast like a muh'fucker
I'm with another bitch by supper
Yeah, me and hate that's an odd couple
Hehe, you niggas fake you wouldn't pop bubbles
You can act stupid, bitch, I'm dumber
And T. Barker is my motherfuckin drummer
Let's go!

[Refrain: Kevin Rudolf]
I'm fallin' down a landslide
On a one-way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride
Well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh-uh uh-uh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm fallin down a landslide
On a one-way trip to you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I been doin' this shit
And you know what they say about the shoe if it fit! Haha
Have a ball 'til I fall though
And if I die today I bet the world end tomorrow
It's fucked up how you ain't never me
And I got blind money, money you will never see
And only in the mirror's where you'll find a better me
I make money and my fingers make the letter B
I'm very sick, very sicker than you
And when I play sick, I'm Jordan with the flu, yeah!
Then I become a motherfucker
And my nigga Travis Barker is my drummer
Motherfucker, let's go!

[Refrain: Kevin Rudolf]
I'm fallin' down a landslide
On a one-way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride
Well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh-uh uh-uh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm fallin down a landslide
On a one-way trip to you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I get better with time and time is forever
So just sit back and watch my time get better
So check your watch, I'm strong as Scotch
Papa was a rollin' stone, I was born to rock
Tell it like it is, shit I don't know when it isn't
To be or not to be; shit, I don't know my decision
I don't know how I made it for this long in this condition
Cause my flow so sick I shoulda died in the first verse
Mr. Dr. Carter with my hand up a nurse skirt
Suck me like soup and I'ma eat you like surf n' turf
Hah! Just let me know when you comin
And my motherfuckin nigga T. Barker keep drummin
Let's go!

[Refrain: Kevin Rudolf]
I'm fallin' down a landslide
On a one-way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride
Well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh-uh uh-uh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm fallin down a landslide
On a one-way trip to you

[Outro: Kevin Rudolf]
On a one way trip to you
On a one way trip to you

[Intro]
The hottest under the sun (who dat?)
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Fuck up my dream, somebody gon' die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

[Verse 1]
Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffin' it
This is Tha Carter, Tha Carter 3, the New Testament
And I'm the God, and this is what I bless 'em with

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
Yeah, Junior

[Verse 2]
It's Cash Money over everythang
It's in my blood, I feel it runnin' in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a Scud
What's really good, I'm 'bout that ruckus like Fudd
And I stayed on my flo' at Cash Money, like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million-heir to the throne
Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Young Money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the Lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm still a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch

[Verse 3]
Last year they had the Grammy's and left me in Miami
Sleepin' on a nigga like I'm rappin' in my jammies
I'm rappin' when you sleep
I was rappin' when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, book 'em, Danny
I'm a monster, I tell you, Monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the House of Pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint—let's go!
Niggas don't wanna see me ‘cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothin' gonna stop me, so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, ha ha

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, bitch I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
Fuck you , you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch!

[Outro]
The hottest under the sun (who dat?)
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
(Who dat?) Somebody gon die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Chorus: Babyface & Lil Wayne]
I'm not saying this to shake you up (saying) (Woo)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (saying)
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
That's all I ask, baby
For granted, 'cause, granted
My love for you is real (Ohh) (Yeah)
And if you don't love me
Somebody else will (Somebody else)
Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable (Yeah)
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest, you can step
Feeling irreplaceable, listening to Beyoncé
Well, okay, I put you out on your b-day
Hey, now if you rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflé?
Don't I look at you like I see a new day?
And don't I do what I do say?
I'm through talking so I'ma let you 'Face
And let 'Ye do 'Ye

[Chorus: Babyface, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm not saying this to shake you up (saying)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (saying) (Yeah)
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, 'cause, granted (Yeah)
My love for you is real (Ohh)
And if you don't love me
Somebody else will (Tryna tell her)
Baby girl, don't you ever get too comfortable
Yeah
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, let me catch my breath
Talking 'bout leaving and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'mma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you will have to settle for less
And I am no Elliott Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the murder scene
'Cause under them sheets, I am a mess
Yes, baby, you're blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on, yeah

[Chorus: Babyface, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm not saying this to shake you up (saying) (haha)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (saying)
It's all good when we making love (We good)
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, 'cause, granted
My love for you is real (Ohh)
And if you don't love me
Somebody else will
Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, it's no sweat, no sweat
I would never 1-2-3-4-get
About you, your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex
Haha, all jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together never disconnect
Yeah, your back, your neck
Funny how that song haven't got old yet
To us, so let's project
You stay in, never incorrect, 'Face

[Chorus: Babyface, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm not saying this to shake you up (saying) (Yeah)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (saying) (I got one)
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love (Yeah)
For granted, 'cause, granted (Hahaha)
My love for you is real (Ohh)
And if you don't love me
Somebody else will (Irreplaceable, huh?)
Baby girl, don't you (Yeah)
Ever (Ha) get too comfortable
Don't get too comfortable, ayy

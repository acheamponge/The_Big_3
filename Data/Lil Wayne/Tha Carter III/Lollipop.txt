[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, lil' mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lyin'
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
But man, I ain't never seen a ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her back it up like, "burp, burp"
And I made that ass jump like, "jerp, jerp"
And that's when she

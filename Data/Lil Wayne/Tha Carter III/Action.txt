[Intro]
Go
I'm in love with a beauty
She is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in the movies
We had a drink or two
We saw Rush Hour 2
Then we went home and we made our own movie

[Chorus]
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours, show you mine

[Verse 1]
Like ooh, ooh, ooh, it's goin' down in this bitch
Like a boxer in the first round in this bitch
1-800, I would dick ya' down in this bitch
Uptown in this bitch, don't make a sound in this, shh
Now let me whisper in ya' ear
Every single word your little ear wanna hear
Flip ya' body over, have no fear
Can I put my tongue here until you tear?
Cry baby, cry baby, suck ya' momma titty
You know I like them old, I might have yo' momma with me
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriends
Honor my pole like a flag on the end, bitch

[Chorus]
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours, show you mine
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours, show you mine

[Verse 2]
I say, "Oh, girl, I love you so"
Oh, oh, girl, I love you so (Psych)
But I don't give a fuck about a dog ass ho
But I don't give a fuck about a dog ass ho
Pop these pills, take, take this glass
Pop, pop that pussy, shake, shake that ass
And if your pussy stank, girl, you know you better douche it
You're nasty, girl, now wash that stanky, funky, funky pussy, bitch
Stop talkin' that shit and suck a nigga dick for an outfit ha
And I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place 'cause you and your man be planning to hate
I'm so hood
And she likes it, and when we fuck, I'm keepin' on my Nikes
I'll tear that pussy up, I'll tear that pussy up
I'm a good looking rapper, I ain't tryna front
Oh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand
Oh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand
Oh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand
And I'm the camera man

[Chorus]
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours, show you mine

[Verse 3]
Cut, check the gates
Wait, why wait?
When I can just bend you over and do what I told ya'
Do what I wanna, do what I wanna
Ya' heard me, I gotta lie, like
And now, every once in a while, her knees jerk
She forgets how to walk, I better teach her
I got her walkin' funny, just tell 'em that your feet hurt
You'll probably see her on one of my t-shirts
I super soak a ho, skeet, skeet, skeet, squirt
But don't worry, cause if y'all are like swingers
Hey, I'm high over features
Haha, new single, oh, so now you single?
You crazy, say "The baby"

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ok, you ain't new shit

You ain't know shit

Pimpin over here
And I ain't Santa Claus
But I can make it reindeer
Money out the ass

I could bunt it out of here
Safe as a mother fucker
Ain't no safety button on this mother fucker
Where's the safe mother fucker
That's the case
Stop the judge of
Weezy F the F for fury
Hang 12 witnesses
That's what I call a hung jury
Brung Jerry Bling Bling
I made that and I don't even say that
As much as judges say that
That's way back
Boy you should catch up
It must of been mine, theys
Long hair pretty eyes light skin fine legs
Phat ass, skinny stomach, pretty feet, pretty woman
Walking down the street cause I put her out my jeep
I don't save 'em
I slave 'em
They want weezy f
I bad grade 'em, I don't degrade 'em
I serenade 'em
100 on the jaw
100 on the arm
Rings so thick I can't even make a fist

I whip it like a slave like a motherfuckin' slave
Yes I whip it like a slave, yes I whip it like a slave

Then I whip it, I whip it, I whip it like a slave

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Kunta Kinte on my shit nigga
Like I ate a plate of roots for dinner
But I ate a plate of loot for dinner
I'm in the garden selling fruit to sinners
Like apple's to Shaq
Hey big spender
And do remember
Just like Brenda
2 grand still get you four and a baby
I'm a kill 'em when I drop like I'm holding a baby
Weezy F, the F is for don't Forget the Baby
And bitch I've been hot but you don't know me from satan
And if you're Manning up you better show me you're Peyton
But you pussies ain't ballin' no Sanaa Lathan
Bricks get shipped
Bricks get cut
Dr Carter
Nip and Tuck

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yes it's me bitches

If you ain't on my train bitch choo choo
Like you got my dick in your mizouth
And I'm a do me bitch with you or without
Shit I'm always right sometimes
And from the top everybody look 1'9
And I'm 2'much
The numbers don't lie
And if they stop making cadillacs
I swear I'm gon' die
And if the weed man ain't got no more onions I'm a cry
And if if was a fifth, then I'd rather drink wine

[Verse 4]
Shit... I'm a take my time
Now am I crazy or just lazy
Cause I'm tired of ballin darlin
And I roll with my riders like it's a harley bar
And we roll with them choppers like it's a harley party
P.S dressed in all red like it was a scarlet party
I was ballin in New Orleans way before the charolette hornets
I'm an X-Man bitch and I ain't talkin marvel comics

Put the dirty dishes in the sink
No pork but I get paid like a piggy bank
I spit like backwash, Sasquatch
No back talk, I act lost
But I bet that money find me

You got them funny diamonds
I got them sunny diamonds
I got them money problems
Like Christopher Wallace
Fuck bitches

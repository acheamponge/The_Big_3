[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Open up your hearts people
Page one, chapter one
Verse motherfucking one
Yeah, uh-huh
I'm drinking hot tea bitch, feel me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, now if you let me you won't regret me
Shit, if you let me you won't forget me
Remember? And if you don't then ponder
Hold up, pow-pow, there's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna
I sweat money and the bank is my shower
Haha, and that pistol is my towel
Haha, so stop sweating me coward
And I would die for ours
Ride for hours, supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it

[Chorus: D. Smith & (Lil Wayne)]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
(I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now
So am I, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home
No more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket
Bitch I'm grown, fuck what you on
Now watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump I'mma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see I am nothing like you, why?
Bitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the stars then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because, I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'll getcha, my picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of "Definition"
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son, I know your barrel burnin', but

[Chorus: D. Smith]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Hey, talk to my daddy
Papa, I did it to 'em! I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again, like nigga backwards
These niggas backwards but they behind us
Now watch me get high like time's up
Nah D, bring the drums back
And watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that
I get respect 'cause if I don't I'mma take it
I see your boys hatin' and I see your girls naked
Drum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb
Then I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aiming at a mirror

[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Watch me soar
Where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher

[Intro: Fabolous]
Yes, what it look like Alc'?
I'm tryin' to show the niggas man
It's that Street Fam man, we rep that, Loso
Street fi-di-di-di-damn

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm with 101 niggas, we dalmatian doggy deep (yes)
And fly with the tongue, so if you feeling froggy, leap (c'mon)
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib, it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied, wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They tryna tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head, nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian, nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired (yes!)
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop-top, they say it's Ocean Drive-inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I get money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Ohh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you ain't never see
Yeah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I'm on the grind 'til the police come
With that pistol on my side, boy, don't be dumb
Or, I let that semi twirl you, now you can follow the drip
'Cause one shot outta the clip'll jheri curl ya (ooh)
Leave you sloppy like seconds, obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents, please
My young boys wildin' for respect
Slit your throat, have you smiling with your neck, say cheese
My dough's a bit longer, my flow is just slaughter (yep!)
My wrist look like frozen Poland Spring water
So tell me boys, tell me boys, who you think you messin' with
I get money out the ass, that's some expensive shit (ill!)
Haven't you all heard? (What?) Y'all all herbs (Yup!)
I stick toothpicks (Where?) in y'all hors d'oeuvres
(Listen) I'm a shark, y'all just koi fish
(What else?) Octopus (What else?) Oysters
Chump! I got my eye on your wifey now (yeah!)
I have her lick me up (up!) and then wipe me down (down!)
She told me you's a nag, you's a bug (damn!)
She told me I'm a blast, I'm a stud (damn!)
She told me you be beastin', you be checkin' for the burns
So I gave her knee pads for the rug (haha!)
It's Skull Gang from the chain to the lifestyle
You surfboard dudes get wiped out, totally

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I'm getting money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Ohh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you ain't never see
Yeah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Get you, 3, 4-get you
Like the number after 1, I'mma get me 2
It's Weezy F.-U, now you gotta have a baby
My money don't folds nor bends, Mercedes
Maybach, grey-black
And I got a 44. and a 'K, like eight stacks
Fuck your city and your town, I state facts
Take that! No, better yet, like Diddy: "Take that"
Wait. rats, I hate rats, I clean 'em out like Ajax
Got paper like a fax machine, asaneen
Damn I mean asinine, I'm dapper don, and after mine
There will be nine, damn I mean, there will be none
I will be one, of the greatest things you've ever felt
You've ever seen, or heard, Car-ter, Har-vard, y'all scared
Not me, not I, call me Young Popeye
Tell Bluto I'm a nuno, I bring RAL to your funeral
Damn I mean funeral, funerol, you say tomato, I say tomahto
You say get 'em, I say got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Man, you better keep payin me cause you don't want my problems
I be wildin' like Capital One, what is in your wallet?
You fly, but what is it to pilot?
Weezy, I'm at the top, foot up in your bottom
Huh, damn I mean, foot up in your ass
I kick that shit now gon' put it in the trash (Deezle!)

[Chorus/Outro: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you'll never see
Yeah, uh, uh
And you ain't got nothing on me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, big money nigga
Big money nigga, big money nigga
Yeah, and you ain't got nothin' on me

[Hook]
Yeah, and we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, and we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, now how ya like me now

[Verse 1]
Got the hog on two-six
Press a button, watch the motherfucker do tricks
I don't know what you on, but I'm on some new shit
While your bitch is on my dick like a glue stick
I got a grill, I don't have to get my tooth fixed
The tooth fairy would retire if I lose it
Straight out the clip, that's how I spit, like an Uzi
You can't find me 'cause I'm lost in the music
I'm running this, and I can jump the hurdles
I'm feeling like I'm racing a bunch of little turtles
Keep a bandana like the Ninja Turtles
I'm like a turtle when I sip the purple

[Hook]
And I smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
And I ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
And we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
And we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
So how ya like me now

[Verse 2]
Buck-sixty on the dash, I'mma do two
Captain Crunch, these niggas is Froot Loops
That's why your girl wanna fuck me and my group too
And I'mma make her back it up like 'droop shoop'
I'm the Birdman Junior, I gotta do coupes
I hop up out that motherfucker, holler "Soowoo"
Hollygrove 17, I'm from the Zoo Crew
You would think every animal in the zoo loose
(Fuck with me) I'm on that screw juice
But I keep my shit together, not a screw loose
Yeah, word to my Gucc' boots
I'm higher than a new suit

[Hook]
'Cause we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, and we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Uh-huh, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Now how ya like me now

[Verse 3]
Buck-forty on a ring that I don't really wear
But I bet it light up the night like the city fair
The shit ain't fair
I didn't have to go there
But all this ice got me feelin' like a polar bear
I'm so aware
I'm so prepared
I'm so fly I will take off into the open air
Liftoff
Cristal
Please
Crackers with cheese
Nigga please
We on J-E-Ts
Like Curtis Martin in white and green
I'm... lightin', lightin', light the thing, light the thing
No reggie man

[Hook]
You know I smoke that kush
And I ball like swoosh
You know I smoke that kush
And I ball like swoosh
Now how you like me now?

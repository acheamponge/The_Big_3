[Verse 1]
Thank you
I've been through it all
The fails, the falls
I'm like Niagara
But I got right back up, like Viagra
I am agri-culture
Swagger so mean it might insult ya
Hah, I'm like an ultra-vulture
I fuck around and catapault ya
Torture
Thought ya parents taught ya?
You guys is chocha
I'm gone, buenos noches
Flow scorcher
And I don't even write
No author
So harder
So smarter
All about a dollar
Like four quarters
Oh Father
Will tonight be my last?
And if so
Make sure my kids see my cash
And I know
I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!

[Hook]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way
'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it
Say I need it

[Verse 2]
C-A-R, T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-er
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, spit sickle-cell psycho
I go
Off, like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from
The underground baby, like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles
Until the light blows

[Hook]
And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling
Living what I believe in, dog
And it's a problem when our homies not eating
And I'm greedy
I'm greedy

[Verse 3]
Share my blood
Feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Gray's Anatomy
Acid, like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Ay, Juelz
I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches tryna kick it like Juntao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off, like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby—great!

[Hook]
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G –
It won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until you're riding to the late me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him every day for my achievements
And I'm Weezy
I'm Weezy

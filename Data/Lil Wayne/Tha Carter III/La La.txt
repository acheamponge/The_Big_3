[Intro]
David-David-David-David-David Banner

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Sittin' in a Caddy, Wright like Betty
Floatin' up the aisle like the bride and her Daddy
Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict
Man I swear I'm on top like the attic
Yeah, bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean but we get dirty like Harry
Flyer than blue birds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck me, I'm all about "oui" like Paris
Hilton presidential suite already
I'm richer than Nicole and I'm a lion like her daddy
I am hotter than the Sun-day after Saturday
I swear I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy
Oscar De La Hoya, box ya like a casket
Or Diego Coralles, nigga keep jabbin'
See, my style it varies, like drugs in a alley
My leather so soft, my paint prettier than Halle
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin' jokes... apparently
A parent, yeah my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her, you kill me, and nigga I ain't 'bout to die
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky
I swear I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
Four tears in my face and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride
Oww!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Verse 2: Brisco]
My paint Bubblicious, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a Kisses
Hershey's, I'm hyphy, somethin' like a piston
And when I'm in Detroit, I be ballin' like a Piston
Oh, and did I mention? I'm fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'
I'm nine under par in a Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream but the Prada's caviar
Weezy, I'm sick from all this tourin'
He told me, "Sip this, and call me in the morning"
Yeah, and I vowed to never trust another woman
In my life, then I got horny

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See I ain't goin' nowhere, bitch, you know a nigga been home, honey
Money fuckin' retarded, call it Down Syndrome money
My cake sick, shit, been diagnosed sickle cell bread
My revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down in Comstock
These bitches call me Bling King, I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas, flawless and D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready
And zoomin' with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you niggas can't believe
Like purchase purses places all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet (Whoa!)
I hope you niggas know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, niggas know I'm handlin' my biz
(Okay)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

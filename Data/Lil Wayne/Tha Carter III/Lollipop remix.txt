[Intro: Lil Wayne]
No homo
I say, he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Remix, baby!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop, the best in the world

[Chorus: Static Major]
She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in the Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo, think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

[Chorus: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper

[Chorus: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

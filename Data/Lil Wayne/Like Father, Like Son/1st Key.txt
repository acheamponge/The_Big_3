[Birdman]
Yeah, hustlin’ on my city streets
Tryin’ to get a whole key (I bought my 1st key, my 1st key)
In ‘93 and we was gettin’ ‘em like for 25
Colombian connect, homey we was gettin’ fly
We on the grind and our nuts got bigga
And every day we in the mothafuckin hood our guns got bigga
Stuntin on them niggas, gettin’ money stayin' fly every day a nigga spendin’
Ridin’ 25’s and we blazin’ gettin’ high, nigga showin’ off his ride
Cruisin’ through the beach nigga rollin’ in them bimmers
Them people pull me over hatin’ ‘cause they can’t see us
Know I got the money (laws won’t leave me alone)
Now they actin funny ‘cause they know a nigga strong
Money long and we comin’

I ain’t have to touch a piece of work since ‘94
I lost my daddy in ‘96 and started makin’ moves
In ‘98 (i got a brand new Lexus coupe)
(now them laws won’t leave me alone)
They pull me over, lock me up, I bail out on my own
I call my poppa on the phone, tell him cook up a zone
I leave a house with a pocket full of stones
Got them hoes slangin’, hidin’ packs in they titties
Them small chest bitches gotta put it in their butt
(20s in them they can’t fuck wit us)
I got so many hoes
(it’s to the flow or I don’t see, don’t know)
(now they won’t leave me alone)
Man I got so much dough
(it’s to the flow or I don’t see, don’t know)
(now they won’t leave me alone)
Weezy baby d boy

[Birdman]
And I ain’t touch a motherfucking ki since ‘04
And that’s the word that we serving, look that’s all we know
Them niggas talking shit but we the niggas wit the cash flow
(i still smoke that weed, smoke that smoke that smoke that weed)
And I’m back on the beach and we blowing out the whole beat
My AK MAC-11 represent the 3
Gangsta like a motherfucker me and my homies

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, my nigga rabbit was a OG
My momma husband that's what show me (my 1st key)
Yup, then you know I had to be a hustler
I started selling hubbers

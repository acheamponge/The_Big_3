[Soprano]
Now the rules of the family has nothing to do with the outside world
The outside world don't count here this is an inner circle of our family
What we say goes
Anybody anyplace else that disrespects you deal with us
If you're with us you're with us, and that's it
That's the way it goes, Are you listeninin to me?
That's the way it goes, there's no such thing
As an outsider comming in, we don't let no one in
We use all of them to do our dirty work
And they come in they do our dirty work and that's just the way it is
Your Family is your life that's what it is life and death

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
One-ninety proof, sub-nine in a shiny coupe
Up-towners inside the booth, shut down anybody who
Come 'round with a lolly gag, leave, found in a body bag
Legs stiff, toes green, give him a title tag
Flossy nigga, but there lies a killer behind the flash
Bossy nigga, so presidential, thanks to my dad
Gotta add, how I got four states to call a pad
I'm mad as a motherfucker, why? I'm rich
Buy a bag, brother, get a nigga high, I'm lit
I'm bad, I hit'chu in ya eye and ya bitch
I hit'cha where ya hide, now ya it, now ya sick
Hot Boy baby, yeah, hot cars, stock car, rock star
What'cha know about it? It's not four babies
Unless you're Weezy F Baby
And please say the Baby when you say it, motherfucker

Cold Saki shots, chilled Patron, half a glass, yeah
Whoa, now she hot, now it's on, now she bent
I let her clothes drop, while she going to my bed
And I'm going to my bed right behind her
Got a couple questions in her pussy

And I might define 'em if I hit from right behind her
And get her how I got her, now she digging my persona
She like a virgin, but like Madonna

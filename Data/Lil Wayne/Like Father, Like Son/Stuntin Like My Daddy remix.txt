"Pyong" on the Yamaha Chromed out 11 hundred
What I'm doing? Getting money. What we doing? Getting money
What they doing? Hating on me But they never cross
Cash Money still the company And bitch I'm the boss
And I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin' like my daddy
I'm the Young Stunna, stuntin' like my daddy
Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin' like my daddy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
Can't see you little niggas cause the money in the way
And I'm - I'm sitting high, a gansta ride, blades
If you ain't gonna ride fly than you might as well hate
Shit, I gotta eat, yeah, even though I ate
No it ain't my birthday but I got my name on my cake
Shit, believe that: if your mans wanna play
I'mma fuck around and put that boy's brains on the gate
Hey pick em up! Fuck em, let em lay
Where I'm from we see a fuckin' dead body everyday
That's - Uptown! Throw a stack at em
Make a song about me, I'm throwing shots back at 'em
Ya bitch on my pipe, and she like a crack addict
She saw me cooking eggs and she thought I was back at it
I grab the keys, "ho I gotta go"
I got my motorcycle jacket and my motorcycle locs

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Shorty, 98's, 45 paper plates
Tint the whole thang, big money heavyweight
A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a Caddy, 25 on the pinky
Bought a pound of blow and bounced back
Matching grills, big houses on the hill
Got them hoes in the kitchen all cooking, paying bills
I start to holler, dollar after dollar
Flipping chickens, getting tickets. Want the money and the power
Born Stunna, Uptown hunter
3rd ward G, nigga, been about money
Ice chunky, Birdman, red monkeys
White Tees on the chromed-out 11 hundreds
You know we shine every summer, we grind every summer
And this is how we spend money
You see them Bentleys and them Lambs'
Them ounces and them grams, bitch we was born hustlas

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah when I was 16 I bought my first Mercedes Benz
I must've fucked a thousand bitches and they girlfriends
White leather, hot new bare rims
Brand new pistol with a trigger like a hair pin
Big work, we don't need a scale man!
Big papers: say "good morning" to the mailman
What you know about putting bricks in the spare, man?
I can stuff a coupe like a motherfuckin' caravan
I'm in my zone, my form is so rare, man
If there's a throne, you looking at the chairman
How you want it, show me my opponent
*Munching noises*
Show me my opponent
I'm still ballin, a bullet gotta get me
And I've never been a pussy cause my hood never let me
A made nigga, got made niggas with me
I'm a motorcycle boy, so I'm about to park the Bentley

[Intro]
I'll pour up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro
I'll pour up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro
Light up that dro, light up that dro
Light up that dro, light up that dro
I'll pour up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro

Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali
(I'm buyin' the bar tonight)
Smokin' up the Cali, smoke, smoke, smokin' up the Cali
(Cause we're smokin' all night at the banquet club, nigga)
(Twelve thousand niggas, smoke a pound, nigga)
Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali

I'll pour up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro
(Yeah, put some chrome
On your... while you're at it nigga)

[Verse 1: Birdman]
So light it up and pass the thang to me
I'm fresh off parole I could smoke a whole P
Can smell it in my clothes you can smell it in my seats
That's how a nigga rolls I was raised in them streets
I'm rolling up a sweet, I'm fillin' it with keef
I'm too high to talk bitch, keep it real brief
If it ain't about money, you don't even gotta speak
I smoke it in a paper, Weezy smoke it in a leaf
And nigga I'mma Stunna, I got runnas
And we keep them shotguns like hunters
We smoke thunder, it put me under
I'm talkin' 'bout straight purple kush that fungus
See I be fuckin' with them trees, cause I'm straight out the jungle
Keep about five pounds and we ain't even tryin' to hustle
Y'all already know how that go
(I'll pour up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro)

[Hook] (x2)
Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali
Smokin' up the Cali, smoke-smoke-smokin' up the Cali
Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali
I'll our up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro

[Lil Wayne]
I get my kush from California, get my dro from Arizona
I can get it 'cross the border, I got a Ryda named Winona
And I be calmer than a soma, inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna, and I stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the maggie on me like a Homer
And I'm too sick, man, I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, y'all blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' Tinsel Town
That's right the prince in town, bitch tear the fences down
Like Prince in town, boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the marvin's day
You wit' me now? Too high you can't set me down

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Daz & (Kurupt)]
We got that AK-47 white right on set painted
And named it orange purple kush that million dollar top brand
(I got that white ivory ice tee, doctors requestin' dope weed)
(Blazin' up so much bomb, I got a bad bitch on my side)
See see we just smokin' we just smokin', we just tryin' to fire up
If you got the bomb bomb nigga come and light it up
(Yeah blaze up ain't nothin like ridin' by, drivin' high)
(Me and all the homies smokin', dumpin' if you chokin' smokin')
Smoke slow when they hit you cuz you might pass out
(Look over at the bitches, snatch a blunt up out her mouth, bitch)
Switch it to another scene, that has you smokin' endo green
(Some homies be on that lean, mix it with that endo weed)
Because we fucked up, we fucked up, you know that we fucked up
(I like to smoke and drink, with that nympho plated thang)
Because we fucked up, we fucked up, you know that we fucked up

[Hook] (x2)

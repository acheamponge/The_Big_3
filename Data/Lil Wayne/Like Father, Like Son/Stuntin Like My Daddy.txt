Shawty! (Ugh) 98s, 45 paper plates
Tint the whole thang, big money heavyweight
A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a Caddy

Bought a pound of blow and bounced back (Bounced back)
Matching grills, big houses on the hills
Got them hoes in the kitchen
All cooking, paying bills (Paying bills)

Flipping chickens, getting tickets
Want the money and the power (Money and the power)
Born stuntin', Uptown hunter (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah! When I was 16, I bought my first Mercedes-Benz
I must've fucked a thousand bitches and they girlfriends
White leather, hot new pair of rims
Brand new pistol with a trigger like a hairpin
Big work, we don't need a scale, man
Big papers: say "Good morning" to the mailman
What you know about putting bricks in the spare, man?
I can stuff the coupe like a motherfucking caravan
I'm in my zone, my form is so rare, man
If there's a throne, you looking at the chairman
How you want it? Show me my opponent
[*Munching noises*] Show me my opponent
I'm still ballin', a bullet gotta get me
And I never been a pussy 'cause my hood'll never let me, yeah!
A made nigga, got made niggas with me
I'm a motorcycle boy, so I'm about to park the Bentley

[Soprano]
You Know While Your Mother Is Cooking The Macaronni
Today I Figured Id Sit Down And Talk To You Since Your Old Enough
You Know Its Time That You Really Realize What This Family Is All About
Cause About This Time Is When Your Gonna Be Able To Join In
And Earn Some Real Money And Real Cash But Before You Do That
I Wanna Teach You A Little Bit About Loyalty
The Main Name Of This Game Is Respect And Loyalty
Family Is A Big Thing When We Do This Kind Of Business
Everything Is With Respect And When A Family Member Gets Outta
Line And Another Family Dont Like It One Thing Leads To Another
And The Next Thing You Know, Your Gone And Then Your Just A Memory Of Me
My Hearts Broke Then, But You Gotta Remember Theres Always Family And Loyalty
Loyalty Is The Main Thing. Obviously You Know I Dont Make My Money
I Dont Make All My Cash From Uh Construction Jobs We Do And
Uh Sanitation And Private Stuff Is All Earned Money Through The Family
And Since Your Of Age Now I Think Its Time I

Taught You What Coming Into The Family And Respect Is All About
So The First Thing You Gotta Learn Is The Name Respect
Tha Means You Dont Cross Nobody You Dont Go Over The Line
Once You Go Over That Line Theres No Coming Back Whether
Youre A Member Of The Family Or Not
Thats When People Get Whacked And We Dont Want Nobody Whacked In Our Family
So I Gotta Teach You The Proper Way Of Respect
When Youre Earning Money, Everybody Earns, Everybody Eats Bread
Its All About Cash Money Thats What Its All About Making The Money
So The First Thing Of Business Is This, You Remember Your Name
You Dont Forgets Your Roots
You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Thats Above You Especially Your Capo
Especially The Big Time Guys, Those Are The Guys You Listen To
You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Unless Your Told To Unless You Get The Okay
And If There Is No Sit Down Theres Nothing

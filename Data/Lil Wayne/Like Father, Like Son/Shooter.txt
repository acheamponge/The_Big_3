[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
I heard some shouts, like: "down on the floor!"
Then - even louder: "we got shooters, shooters!"
I turn around, I was staring at chrome
Shotgun watches door, got security good
Jumped right over counter
Pointed gun at, wink, he tell her
"I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter"

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So many doubt cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang! Die bitch-nigga die! I hope you bleed a lake
I'mma play x-ray, helping y'all see the fake
I'm just trying to be the Great, trying to get a piece of cake
Take it off of your plate, eat it right in your face
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen
Call me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow!

[Break: Robin Thicke]
All these bitches and, all these bitches!
But ain't no lovers around
They thinking about shooting! Them shooters
Got the guns, girls. Ladies, them gunners that
Shoot shoot shoot shoot! Shooters!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
And to the radio stations, I'm tired of being patient
Stop being rapper racists, region-haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick-takers
It's outrageous! You don't know how sick you make us
I want to throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

[Break: Robin Thicke]
Lady walks into a shotgun surprise
Dropped to her knees, saw her life before her eyes
He said: "bitch is gonna get it, everybody gon' regret it
I'm your - shooter!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Socks soaking wet, I been running y'all
I reload every hundred yards, I'm comin' forward, you better know me
Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard
Take pain like Tylenols, raw
Way past par, far, I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw
And then they ask who, when, where, how and
My reply was simply, "Pow!"

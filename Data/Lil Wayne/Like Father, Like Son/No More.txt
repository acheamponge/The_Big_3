[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I got the brown bag full of money
I got the work goin to florida
And I swore that I won't ever hustla no more
But I don't never say that no more got my mind
Right nah
I got the brown bag full of money
I got the work goin to florida and I swore
That I won't ever hustla no more
But I don't never say that no more got my mind
Right money right

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
The pots hot as the rock expands it the paper chasin'
Man on the clock like hands grindin
Like teeth get money like Heathcliff huxtable keep it comin
Like keith gotta make last forever for worse
Or for better gotta make it past the devil
So guns I got several and everybody plays the fool says aaron
Nevelle but I just play to win holler back like heavy metal
Smellin like pedals from a rose so they hoes
My breads buildin bagels and legos when I rose
They froze trust me for the pesos I'm an a hole AK holes
Think face blow and understand talkin money
By the case loads gun off safety I'm in safe mode
I will hold court until the case closed
Brown bag bitch

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I got the brown bag full of money

And I swore that I won't ever hustla no more
But I don't never say that no more got my mind

[Verse 2: All Star Cashville Prince]
Young new investment ain't no turnin me back
Had the rubber band stacks in the button king sack
And I ain't never goin back sike I love the life standin
Under the street ilght tryin to get off that white
At a reasonable price nah I ain't tryin to bargain
Wit ya niggas hatin well I guess they gonna be
Starvin wit you I got 2 jobs I sell and cop shit
Like father like son well I was adopoted
I told the birdman stunna gimme a chance and I don't even wanna
Tell you waht I did with my advance cause I'm only a man
I had to feed my fam takin that hood shit
And copped 3,024 grams man I guess it is what it is it
Was what it was before the rap game I waas sellin drugs
Either way I'm six figures before my first record
Allstar, y'all gon' respect my work ethics I'm a hustla

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

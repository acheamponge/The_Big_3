[Intro]
We here
I said, we here
The back of Tha Carter, yeah
The back of Tha Carter â€“ Two
Uhg, yeah
This here is
The end of Tha Carter Two, people
Hey, yeah

[Verse]
I got the game
On ball and chain
I threw the key in the drain
I'm like a ki in a drought
I spent a G on these frames
But my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggas
Like a fuckin' psychic
Hearing through the grapevine
Niggas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift
Man you better be Peyton
Boy the heat's on
They making peace bonds
I'm in this bitch throwing up the "17" sign
Straight frowns, no daps
Strapped three times
A Tec-11, AK-47, one Beretta
Ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niggas come together
Heavy better, nigga
Super-soaker wet a nigga
Six feet under flowers
You ain't nothing but a petal, nigga
I'm just a little nigga
Trying to be a civil nigga
30 years old, shit
That'll be a given, nigga
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listening
But she ain't really tripping
'Cause the pots is pissed in
Them niggas trippin'
Until the shots whistlin'
Hear them bullets hissin'
Like a cobra at attention
I got a bitch, and quit calling women bitches
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true player, no quittin'
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin'
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
And since the future ain't promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in that heat 'til the motherfucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope
Let 'em tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless
Rats and roaches
Running 'cross the porch
In the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it
Automatics in motion
We banging for the bread
Nigga, even the molded
I got my loaf
I got my toast
Chaperone of the South
I got my coast
Yeah, and until I die
I'm the Best Rapper Alive

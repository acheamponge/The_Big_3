[Interviewer:]
So "Little Wayne," what's your motivation?

[Lil' Wayne]
Is that really a question?
Do you really have that written down in your notepad?
You should be ashamed of yourself
You smell me girl
I smell like money
See, thats what they don't understand (Tell 'em a god damn thang)
To me it was always get money or die
I come up under Birdman, the Number One Stunna
You know what I mean I'm Stunna Jr. thats all I know thats all I ever knew
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying
And I feel that way
Foreal

[Verse 1]
So hard I go I keep pushing
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep pussy
I got chip from trying to get the whole cookie
Used to make a thousand dollars everytime I played hookie
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking
I'm present on the block
I'm a legend on the block
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch
Yea nigga I done dropped one eleven on the watch
So watch and see what I do

I got to bring the hood back after Katrina
Weezy F Baby, now the 'F' is for FEMA
Sick nigga bitch I spit that Leukemia

Feel me

[Lil' Wayne]
And that's just my point right there
That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me you know

[Interviewer]
So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?

[Lil' Wayne]
I mean, I would say the voice of the hood cause thats who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean, my family thats who I represent
My homies, my girl, my life you know

[Verse 2]
C'mon, bang this shit nigga pump my shit
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit
Like motherfuck them niggas what they wan-do I'm ready
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo
Fucking with the boy baby that's a gamble
If he won in Vegas leave him on the crap table
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper
Gotta get it gotta have it
Once I got it I'mma spend it
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it
The re-ups be like birthday parties
No room to park the cars in the garages
So outside the cribs all you see is arayis
If I ain't say it right fuck it I ain't foreign
Feel me

[Lil' Wayne]
And see thats where everybody get me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, foreal

[Interviewer]
Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?

[Lil' Wayne]
Thats because they ain't got that heat rock like me you know what I mean
They ain't spitting like me
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds
I got the flu over here man, foreal
I need relief, y'all help me

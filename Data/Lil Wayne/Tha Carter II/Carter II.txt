[Intro]
So you made it this far
We upstairs
I let you up here
You special
Marley, don't shoot 'em
You know what this is
It's still Tha Carter II, people
It's still Tha Carter II, people
Yeah, you're still in Tha Carter II, people
Hey! Yeah

[Verse]
All I have in this world
Is a pistol and a promise
A fistful of dollars
A list full of problems
I address 'em like P.O. boxes
Yeah I'm from New Orleans
The Creole cockpit
We so out of it
Zero tolerance
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still fucking with that block shit
Wet your ass up, head to feet, 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter
Tell the gardener cut the grass
I hear 'em, but they talking under masks
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money honey pie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screaming "Fuck the other side"
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds
I put your heart on it
And walk on it
The chalk's only for the art, homie
How they trace ya
After I erase ya?
Look around
We at war
And you still in preparation
I'm riding for them reparations
No patience
Slow paper
Is better than no paper
Fast money don't last too long
You got to pace it
You got to know that paper
If you got it from a caper
Got to blow that paper
Got to know that
Photophobia
No Kodak moments
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em
Naw, I ain't even in the school yearbook
I don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look
Career crook
Get your career took
I'm back, like a brassiere hook
Bitch, cheer
Camouflage gear
The hunter's here
Better play it by ear
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here
And this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot
Out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boy some dipping sauce
I want the whole enchilada
I got 'em by the collar
Watch me drop 'em
On the head, at the bottom
And you ain't got to shoot 'em
'Cause I already shot 'em
And I ain't got to get 'em
'Cause I already got 'em
Get 'em

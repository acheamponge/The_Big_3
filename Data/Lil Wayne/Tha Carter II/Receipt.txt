[Intro]
It's kinda hard saying this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away

[Hook]
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt
Yeah, to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need)

[Verse 1]
Young broad
I know you love me like you never loved
You know you couldn't find a better thug
And, uh
You been peepin' me since I was younger
So young
That you even called me your little brother
But I'm all grown up now
I got my own money
I'm married and divorced
And my daughter is a woman
And guess what?
My daughter want another
Sister or brother
And you lookin' like a mother
I took you from a clubber to a lover
And you took another bitch husband
The other bitch wasn't
Doing shit for him
She say she did too much
I say she did nothing
She need to quit fronting
I haven't hid nothing
And you love everything
Can't hide your feelings
Won't let my pride conceal it
You got Wayne
I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change
But—

[Verse 2]
Destiny Child CD
Song number three
She cater to me
'Til we fall asleep
Then we wake up
And we pick up where we started
Then she make a nigga breakfast
Sprite, orange juice, and water
And she on stage
Waiting for me after my show
So no time for groupies
Straight to the top floor
Fresh out the shower
A smile and a towel
Then after an hour
She gon' need another shower
When I'm at home
In my coupe
Or in the office
Or the streets of The Boot
I'm thinking 'bout you
And most of the girls that come by are cute
And they try to holla, but they all on mute
And my old girls turn they face up at me
Yeah, they throw they purses and they makeup at me
'Cause you got Wayne
I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change
But—

[Verse 3]
Come home
Smell the food on the stove
She done cleaned the whole house
Washed the dishes and the clothes
And when we out
We do it just how we supposed
Look good for the public
Leave the drama in the Rolls
Royce
Choice of car that we move in
She gets high sometimes
'Cause I'm always doin' it
You hear them hallways
We always doin' it
Work cut
Every time feel like the first one
Perfect
When a nigga stressin' at work
She take away all of the pain
Make it lesser than dirt
That's why you got Wayne
I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change
But—

[Outro]
I got you
It's kinda hard saying this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take her away

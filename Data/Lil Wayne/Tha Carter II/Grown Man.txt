[Intro: Lil Wayne]
What's up baby?
I ain't trying to do nothing but get my grown man on
I ain't trying to hurt you
Only if you want me to
Yeah, something like that

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, what's happenin' baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the navy, now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene
Goddamn it I'm so mannish
Handle it like a standard
So put yo panties and yo pants my the trash can
Romance on the floor plans, yeah
We hold hands while we rolling, just trying to keep up with the program
Just trying to sneak up on ya, like how you doing ma'am
I'm a old soul, and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Curren$y]
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Now I don't really hit the club but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' the way you walk when you move yo booty applaud
I gotta keep my composure
I gotta attack my mission and handle business like a soldier
Young man, Young Money but the money long
Curren$y, The Hot Spitta so grown
And your perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry about what you heard about me and them other birds
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of them hurt
But whatever has occurred they all got what they deserved
And you don't rock like that, I can see it in your eyes
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise
Cause tonight you looking like Miss Right
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you

[Hook]
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Baby girl, living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now
Fly boy baby sit back, relax and
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction
Whose is it baby? She say, "Weezy Fuckin' Baby"
I say, "Yes in-fuckin'-deed," she say, "Don't you ever leave"
I say, I say, "But I got money on my mind"
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time [laugh]
For a large amount of time, long and won't stop 'til daytime come home

[Hook]
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Damn, look, that
Oh, that right there?
That's the sunset girl
Get your visor, where those Chanel shades I get you, you always losing things
And I'm always buying new things, I come a long way huh, remember?
Remember that block, look at you, you think you all grown

[Outro:]
You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now

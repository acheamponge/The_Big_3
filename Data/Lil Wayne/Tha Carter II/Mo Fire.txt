[Hook]
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, give 'em
Mo' fire

[Verse 1]
I diddy bop, my fitty cocked
My city hot, I'm dodging the city cop
I play 'em like Pitty Pat, yeah, I'm kicking back
Yeah, I'm getting stacks, these bitches is really rats
I fuck 'em and give 'em back, yeah, I really mack
Yeah, how real is that? You love 'em you really wack
I hustle and bend my back, my muscle is intact
My biceps and triceps is ahh, yes

[Hook]
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, I give 'em
Mo' fire

[Verse 2]
I'm coming through, in something new
The color is smurf blue, I'm puffing that purple
Believe it; if I talk it, I walk it, like Herschel
I get it like it is on a commercial, first too
This is verse two; it is worse, too
I'll murk you like I birthed you
You niggas small bubbles, I'll burp you
And spit you out and have your girlfriend slurp you
My jewelry earth blue, some say it's earth green
I'm like; whatever, my shit mean and obscene
Now I've been seen on a lot of different scenes
That mean I got a lot of different cream

[Hook]
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, I give 'em
Mo' fire, yeah

[Verse 3]
I raise more fire to the man up higher
I lick a shot to let Him know that I'm a rider
My dreads hang to let Him know that I'm a lion
Represent the jungle when the others just tryin'
I represent my mother like "Baby, stop cryin'"
I know my papa gone but guarantee he see I shinin', yeah
Now you are looking at New Orleans' finest
Now you are being blinded by European diamond
And you are seein' two-or-three times, and
Got your vision all fucked up, now you can't even find me
And I ain't even hidin', naw, I'm right here baby
She wanna walk and shit, I'm like "Yeah, baby"
Batty man, get the shotty to his head
Rock-a-bye his ass to sleep, rock it, lay him down to bed
I'll put you in my pocket, right next to the condoms, homie
You ain't nothing but a profit, shit

[Hook]
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, I give 'em
Mo' fire

[Outro]
Yeah, mo' fire
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, give 'em
Mo' fire

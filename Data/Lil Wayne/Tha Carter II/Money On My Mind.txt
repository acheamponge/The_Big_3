[Intro]
Yeah!
Money on my mind, money on my mind (Geah!)
Money on my mind, money—money on my mind (Geah!)
Money on my mind, money on my mind (That's right)
Money—Money on my mind
So money is all I think of (That's right)
Money on my mind, money on my mind (Bitch!)
Money on my mind, m—m—m—money on my mind (You know!)
M—M—M—Money on my mind (Bitch!)
Money—Money on my mind (Bitch!)
Money—Money on my mind
So money is all I think of (Ayy!)

[Verse 1]
Stepping out the motherfucking car, they in awe (Yeah)
I'm looking like a star, bitch, when you see me make a wish
Holla at your motherfucking boy, J-R (Brrrr!)
Birdman my pa, bitch, ball bred, born rich (Yeah)
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed 'cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip and that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp, then, like ranch, I dip (Gone)
And the hustle is all muscle, just strength
When it comes to that weight
I don't struggle, I just lift (One-two)
I got my hand on the game, yeah, I make a grip (Yeah)
Hundred grand in my fist, same on my wrist
Get ki money from a quarter, blame it on my wrist (Haha)
I whip coke like hoes, nigga, I'm a pimp (Yeah)
Lil nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money, baby, now we talking

[Chorus]
M—M—M—M—Money on my mind (Yeah)
Money on my mind
Money on my mind, m—m—money on my mind

Fuck bitches, get money
M—M—Money on my mind, so money is all I think of
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2]
Yeah! Nigga, get it in a slumber, if you know how (Ugh)
In the heart of the summer, we need a snowplow
What you know about that? Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions on the phone, we call it "blowjobs" (Yeah!)
Too fast for the feds, too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch
Getting sloppy with the pots (Bitch!)
Hopping off the boat, meeting Papi at the docks (What up?)
He tell me I'm gaining weight, I tell him I'm getting paid (Yeah)
"Money over bitches," I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age (What?), go after what pays (Yeah)
These Gabbana sunshades block the Sun rays (Bitch)
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date (Damn!)
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way (Yeah)
That cake, like it's—it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, you heard me?
Where money's more important than a person, nigga!

[Chorus]
M—M—M—M—Money on my mind (Yeah)
Money on my mind
Money on my mind, m—m—money on my mind
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Money on my mind, money on my mind
M—M—M—Money on my mind, so money is all I think of
Get money, get money, get money
Money on my mind, money—money on my mind (Yeah)
Money—money on my mind, money—money on my mind
Get money, fuck bitches
Money—money on my mind, money—money on my mind
Fuck bitches, get money
M—M—Money on my mind, so money is all I think of
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 3]
Twisting up a blunt, thinking 'bout my next dollar (Okay)
I'm digging in the game tryna get some money out her (Okay)
I'm so vain, it's a problem (Yeah)
There ain't a stain on these Pradas (Uh-uh)
I'm just being modest (Yeah)
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it (Bitch)
She still down, and she don't get none of the profit (Yeah)
Wheel 'round the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold motherfucker, whoever inside it" (Yeah)
Forever symbolizing the grind, it don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do (Ugh)
Giddy-up, baby, if he got it, then hit him up, baby (yeah)
I know it's crazy, but I can't get enough, baby (Yeah)
I love it, I fucking love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public (Haha!)
Riding to myself, 'cause I don't fuck with nothing
Pistol on my lap, on the way to the money!

[Chorus]
M—M—M—M—Money on my mind (Yeah)
Money on my mind
Money on my mind, m—m—money on my mind
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches (Yeah)
Money on my mind, money on my mind
M—M—M—Money on my mind, so money is all I think of
Get money, get money, get money (Bitch!)
Money on my mind, money—money on my mind (Yeah)
Money—money on my mind, money—money on my mind
Get money, fuck bitches
Money—money on my mind, money—money on my mind

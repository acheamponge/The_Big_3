[Intro]
Yeah, okay I'm strapped
Get 'em!
Black Hat, black shades
Black diamonds, oh, behave!
No, he can't, with the fucking seats back
Got the paint job coke and the fucking seats cracked

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I'm a d-boy; bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power, I'm gone!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Thinking of a master plan, I get money
But I'm thinking of a faster plan, I'm trying to cash it in
I got five in that garbage can
And the wrap Saran, I need cash advance
See, I know three sold, the other two a jam
I'mma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can
Hot-ass fuckin' sedan, windows rolled down, no sound
Them bricks got the speakers drowned
I ain't listening for shit but sirens
I ain't trying to get to my ships sunk, fuck you pirates
I'll touch you cowards, it ain't nothing to a boss
The niggas in the hood tryna floss
And ya head got a cost, nigga
Take a loss nigga, SS 55 all black, with the top chopped off that
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at
I ain't trying to prove nothin, I'm just trying to move somethin

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block (Yeah)
I got the money and the power, I'm gone! (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
See we cooking up a thousand grams
I'm in the kitchen over the stove with pots and pans
Triple color with the platinum jams
50 birds, homeboy, in the back of a van (Bitch!)
A hundred grand in rubberbands
We got them birds in the coffee cans
We got the whips with the extra clips (Yeah, nigga)
Got bitches outta state, niggas flippin' them bricks
Been in the Caddy, been in the alley (Uh-huh)
Nigga been on the block (Yeah) right in front of Miss Gladys
Nigga know bout hustlin', know bout stuntin'
Did the curb-serving (Yeah), shined every summer (Beyotch!)
Been on front, been in the back
Nigga roll with duct tape and ride with the Mac (Pow!)
See these haters like, "fuck them niggas"
We made men, millionaires, hustlin' our nature

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power, I'm gone!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
8 AM, open my eyes
Yeah, kick my bitch, tell her open the blinds
And I'm over the stove at 9
Yeah, I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine
Yeah, quick line in the bathroom before we bounce
Not me, I mean her, she go a-day-an ounce, damn
Y'all pray for her, while I'm at the bus station
In the Bentley sitting low as I wait for her, yeah
I'm gettin' dough, I'm a paper-boy
I will take you, for the right paper, boy
I will take her, shake her, tape her, waist up
Send her to the money, she be back before I wake up, ha!
Getchya cake up, y'all niggas lame ducks
You probably get your game up when I'm giving the game up
My name Wayne, what! Hot Boy, flame up
You niggas trying to change up and I'm getting my change up

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a d-boy, bitch, I'm a d-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rov' for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money in my block
I got the money and the power, I'm gone!

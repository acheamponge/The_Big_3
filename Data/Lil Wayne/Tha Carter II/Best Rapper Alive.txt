[Intro]
Fuck with me? Thank you, come on, yeah
Yeah, come on, you know me man
Oh Fee, I got 'em boy
Baby, Slim too, alright, Weezy Baby
You can't see me, but I see you, and I see you
Lord! I-I-I got 'em

[Verse 1]
Bring the crowd, and I'm loud in living color
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby, got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't asking them for nothing
If you sell a million records we could battle for your money
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in
God, I hope they snapping at the end of my rod
I hope I'm fishing in the right pond
And I hope you catching on to every line — Who am I?

[Chorus]
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, uh, game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid

[Verse 2]
The heart of New Orleans, thumping and beating
Living and breathing, stealing and feeding
Peeling and leaving, killing and grieving
Dearly departed, erased, deleted
No prints, no plates, no face, no trace
Out of sight, out of mind, no court, no case
Sell his chain, celebrate, block party, second line
Zulu Ball, Essence Fest, Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras
Shotty bounce, body rock, now he dropped, now he got
Family try, tell the feds, tell the cops
Smell the rat coming back to the house, to the spot
Tap-tap, knock-knock, "Who is that?" Chkk-pow!
Triggaman, hoodie man, tell the kids, Boogieman
Pistol Pete, Ammo Mammal, gunman, blum-blam!
Haha! Damn, Sammy, you done fucked up
Pussy ass niggas, put your nuts up, just call me —

[Chorus]
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid

[Verse 3]
Fuck up with all these rookie MCs?
Whew! Smell like a bunch of pussy to me
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em good! Fuck 'em long!
Fuck 'em hard! Fuck who? Fuck 'em all!
Yeah, like that, just like that, right back
I'm on that money train and that Mac'll knock 'em off track
The quarterback, well protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack, I spit that cardiac
You can't see me, baby boy, you got that cataracts
I'm right here, straight out the hood just like an alley cat
Since everyone's a king, well where the fuck your palace at?
Me? I got callous on my hands, I can handle that
It's no problem, baby, I so got 'em
It's just a victory lap, baby, I'm just joggin'
Yeah, and I ain't even out of breath
The motherfuckin' best yet — Sorry for cussing (Who?)

[Chorus]
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
The best rapper alive, the best rapper alive
Swagger right, check, game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid, yeah

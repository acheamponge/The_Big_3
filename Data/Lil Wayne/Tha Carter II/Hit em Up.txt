[Intro]
Yeah
I tried talk to him

[Verse 1]
Quit talking, I’ma hang you by your tongue, yeah
Any motormouth could get hung high
We don’t fuck with niggas, like fungi, we don’t even hear ya
Hollering bullshit, nigga, cut the diarrhea
(Get 'em!) Pistol lie inside of the arm rest, umm, yes
Lay a nigga down in his own mess, don’t mess
Player fuck around with the homeless, charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies
(Go!) Honest, you niggas is harmless
I’m calm as a Don is supposed to (be), Cosa Nostra
Don’t ever approach him, don’t get close to him
Shootouts ain’t nothing but rock-n-roll to him
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rosewood
‘Nother murder, ‘nother page out the notebook
It ain’t nothing, and don’t make it if you no good
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up (Gunshot)
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him

[Verse 2]
(Y’all) Take them shoes off your teeth, stop runnin’ your mouth
No shoes, no feet, I’ll run in your mouth
I’ll come to your house, me and my goons
Loading up bangers, riding under the moon
Throwing up fingers, saying, “My side rule”
If a nigga disagree, that’s what my side prove
That Maybach Coupe a cock-eyed fool
And I’m in it like Bennett, ho, aren’t I cool
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and that heat’ll move
I got that Chiquita banana clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe, swallow the truth, belch reality
How does it taste? Powder your face, you a bitch nigga
All pussy, stop coming out your lips, nigga
I tried to talk him, but then a nigga had to

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up
(Gunshot) I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him

[Verse 3]
Real talk, boy, chill with the talk, boy (yeah)
That Tommy gun’ll tear your neighborhood apart, boy (blatt!)
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
You start with the wrong boy, it end with a song, boy (oh)
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone (yeah)
Fuck the discussion, I ain’t into it, boy
I just get to it, let’s do it, rip through a boy (bah!)
Big Uzi, just shoot a boy
I’m inside looking out, you just an intruder, boy (get em!)
You need sutures on your smoochers, boy, but
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up
(Gunshot) I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him

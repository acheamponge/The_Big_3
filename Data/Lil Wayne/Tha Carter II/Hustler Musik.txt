[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Hit me
Right in the sternum this time, T-baby
Shit, you already know, you already know
You already know, damn, shit
This that hustler musik
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler music
So ride to it y'all, vibe to it y'all, damn

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one, see you fucking with the boy
Who tote toys way before Christmas, no assistance, just
That persistence, with that commitment, if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight, and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die on this song
See I be riding, just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind, like, "You gotta be kidding"
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the mothafuckin
So I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the mothafuckin...

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do for me and you
And we eating, so, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no, Lord

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun
Got to run when I hear the bird call: (Brrrr!) Damn
Hop in that thing and merk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ah-ahh)
Anybody's murderer if Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of the Opera, all black, guap tent, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, "What it do, what it do"
There's a full court pressure, I'm just going for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothing
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothing
I take it for what it's worth, to the dirt, motherfucker, yeah!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do for me and you
And we eating, so, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge; if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no, Lord

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I ain't never killed nobody, I promise
And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrrat!
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got Nina in my palm, and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly 'til I die, what you saying?
Bathing Ape, Yves St., Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here, right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores and they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothing, now get your hustle up

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do for me and you
And we eating, so, bitch, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge; if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no, Lord

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Man, man, this be that hustler musik
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler musik y'all
So ride to it y'all, and vibe to it y'all
I'm asking y'all, please, please
Young Weezy got that hustler musik
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler musik
Ride to it y'all, vibe to it y'all, vibe to it y'all, chyeah, chyeah
It's trill shit man, it's real talk man
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it
Ayy, it's real shit man, it's real talk boy
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it
I ain't bragging, I ain't boasting, it's the way it go
I ain't bragging, I ain't boasting, that's the way it is
Better guard your kids, guard your face
Better guard your body, we warned the place
We here! Fuck bitches! It's Young Money, nigga

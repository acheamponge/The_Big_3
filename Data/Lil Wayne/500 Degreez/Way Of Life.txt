And we gon run this for you, ya heard?

[Female]

[Lil Wayne]
Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins
Hit the mall wit my girlfriends, dish out ends
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it
Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stunt
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups

[Baby]
Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs
Cadillac Truck, 28's, no rubs
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins
It's the Birdman daddy, with the Gucci Prada
Slant back Cup Truck, no rims - can't holla
It's that Louie Fendi on Ostrich streets
It's the tailor-made daddy, mami do you love me?

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Baby]
Pop one, pop two with the new Nike shoes
Royal blue jag on 'em 22's
Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

[Lil Wayne]
It's lil whoadie from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...
Blingy blingy, yo stop blinking though
We smoke stinky stinky dro
And we don't cop them incy wincy o's
And we don't stop, nah, we blow
Fuck the pee-ple
Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo
Birdman, my Paw so that make me go.. fly like an eagle, fasheezy

[Baby]
See they think cause I stay English turn
That stunna don't ever OZ to burn
I go in each over and ball like a dog
Me and my niggs ball like a dog
Cars on my streets, all on the lawn
Ice in my teeth, all on my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Lil Wayne]
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life
See, I'm a Bro-fessional - you a rookie
Fuck, a game so serious I could sell a hooker some pussy
That's some serious shit
Oh yeah, believe that
Who we rollin wit?
We rollin wit Cash Money
Oh, I forgot about peace - Peace!
I mean.. piece of pussy, piece of land, piece of property
Just a mind game
Piece of mind, ya know
Piece of something, motherfucker!

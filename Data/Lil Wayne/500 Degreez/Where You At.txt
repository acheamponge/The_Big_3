[Hook]
All my niggas if you with me

All my soldiers if you with me
Where you at? (oh!)
All my hustlers if you with me
Where you at? (oh!)

Soldiers if you with me

Hustlers if you with me
Let me hear you say (oh!)
Say, say (oh!)
Say, say (oh!)

[Verse 1]
Aye (Oh!)
I come and do my thang and hold down my side
Eagle Street man throw my set up high
Weezy we gang call them boys that squad
That squad, squad up! you know
And we get a lot of dough on the strength of me
Get a lotta dro on the strength of Fee
Get a lot of blow
But keep that on the D
D what?...DL! you know
And oh you don't wanna fuck with a nigga
'Cuz a nigga might fuck with the trigger
Leave a nigga on the floor
Truly I don't buck with you nigga
Let my tooly talk, talk to you nigga
Bitch man is an itch to a rich man whoa
'20s on the six with the kicks sitting low
Sticky in my swish man gasoline floor
Fire spit man Weezy is about to blow
Ya know!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Aye (oh!)
Pass the pine to the pimp old juice killer
Catch your eye in one glimpse old school with the
Ass up high the front dip drip bam
Mami like damn, Lil Wayne stop playing
Baby I'm a baller I hustle with my father
It's the Birdman and Birdman Jr
I flip them birds man eighteen grand just order
Eighty-five for half and forty-five for quarter
Yeah! Tity baby put it in the air
I'm jumping out this atmosphere
And I'm jumping in your bitch if she had a player
Jumping in the painted thing on them dang-a-dangs
You see the arm when I pass nigga bang-a-lang
You now I'm armed we can mash man it ain't a thing
You know I'm calm but I'm a gorilla ain't a game
I got a banana clip for all you orangutans
Let's bang!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Aye (oh!)
It's young Weezy can't none see me dawg
I get you done easy with one easy phone call
And the sawed-off make your arms fall off
Like a short sleeved polo, won't bother me no more
Ice like strobe light, look like I'm moving slow mo'
Ferrari look nice on low pro Yokohomas
With '20 inch chromes poking out 'em
Chrissy till the dome tote the ganja
Red-bone in the shower
Hello! Pocahontas give a long stroke poke for hours
Floating vagina hoe, I'mma holla
Sold coke in the '90s, I'm honest man
Nothing big maybe ounces, grams
But I know how to double, and sometimes it's scams
But I know to hustle, and some Glocks'll jam
But I know how to bust 'em, and some drops'll slam
All alloy buttons that's all stunting
That boy's something
Yeah!

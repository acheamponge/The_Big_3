Got that work, you a D boy (Believe that daddy)

All the niggas on the block that got that work to move

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
It's Weezy baby, young and from the Dirty South
Get up your dope, I'm putting birdies out
Like thirty in my mouth, so I can say
Fuck you bitch you still ain't got a dirty mouth
The hood still ain't got over the drout
So you should sleep on your roof, just to watch over ya house
Nigga we timin', the cost of my watch over ya house
I'm a boss man, I watch over the South
Jazze Pha, let's hop in the Lammy (Lamborghini)
Stop by Sammy, chill in the hood, you good, you family
My boys like to pull them blammies, and big pimp
Mami suck dick 'til she pull your hammy, homey
You know we only, keepin it gangsta
Deep in the Range, 17 in the chamber
All I need is my banger, nigga it's Weezy
This shit is over somebody cue me

(Chorus)

(Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne)
You don't wanna play wit me, I touch you man
Lose ya man in a tussle, but y'all don't see me
Y'all can't hear me, this a def jam, call me Russell, man
I played on Martin, call me hustle, man
And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or
High with water, how do you want it man
Ay, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun
I den drove a lot of QP's from, here and there on the road
For the nigga gotta move his son, and I show you how to do this son
That's, that boy Weezy We, CMB, BITACH, and ya stunned

(Chorus)

[Lil Wayne]
Who that, Weezy Bitch
Like Sigel, you fuckin with the young don, people
Plus I'm tryna make a son, he gon' be the sequel
Muh'fuckas better be peaceful, fo' sheezle
I get sums in lumps, like measles
My dough sick, on occations I catch seizures
I treat beef like burgers, just cheese you
And for that cheddar, hungry niggas'll eat you
We breeze through in the twelve with the judo eyes
Bitches yell I wanna do those guys
Ain't that cold, you know shit fucked up when you got banked at fo'
I'm 19 and I got banked at O
That's the Bentley ma, that ain't that Rolls
But the price on that muthafucka ain't that low
Guaranteed that I'll bang that fo'
If your fuckin with the dude
Bitch I'm from Cash Money Records, Fuck You

[Hook x8]
Fuck you, fuck you nigga, muthafuck you

[Mannie Fresh]
Chains, knives, guns that's us
The slogan is "we will bust"
The rules our this our side
Cross it young nigga and you will die
Pumps, riot guns, even 25's
Cash Money got this, don't even try it
Stay where you from, don't bring no static
If not, then semi-automatic
This is the payback, pussy bitch stay back
Fuck you, yo' mama, yo' daddy and where you lay at
What's beef, beef is when you fuck with us
Guaranteed to leave yo' ass up under the bus
There's no one quicker, than a hot boy nigga
That'll get you with the knife, or pow with the trigger
There's no one keaner, with the chrome Sarafina
Murder ain't nuttin' but a misdemeanor

[Hook x4]

[Baby]
Fo' sho' nigga
I'm gon' ride 'round my city and stunt my shit
If a nigga don't like it they can suck my dick
I got a Bentley, Jag, Rolls, Ferrari
Lambo' with no top I'm gon' ride tomorrow
Fuck a cutless, regals, and rams V-12
Gotta have somethin fast just to get out them jams
Got a big ass crib with a flow lil fuck
Got a roof all glass and that bitch split up
Got a house built look like a Mercedes booth
Ferrari sofa set with the Lambo' wrench room
Leskitted up kitchen set and Rolls Royce wall
Jaguar floors and fuck all yall
BMW lights, projectors to watch fights
Caddilac Benz, white fox for threads
Chin cheddar for Chi tower, ain't that crazy
I don't give a fuck homie, that's how I play it
Refridge designed like a Lexus with legs
In the fridge, it's quarters to replace the eggs
From me, Fresh, and Weezy fuck what they say
I'm Cash Money stunna nigga and that's how I play it

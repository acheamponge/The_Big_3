Let me bring you up to speed (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
It's Wayne's World

[Chorus]
Party time excellent, I party hard (Huh)
I pull up in the Bugatti on God (Rr)
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours"
I just said, "Sure, it's Wayne's World"
Party time excellent, I party hard (Yeah)
I party hard even when times is hard (Yeah)
I just go hard, party time, excellent

[Verse 1]
Pull up on your street and that shit was Sesame
I'm with my Mexican, gang-bangin' heavily (Huh)
Throw up your set at me, that I don't recommend (Hoo)
I pull up in the Bugatti, we're not gon' bother
And in the trunk, we got the elephant (Ooh)
Know who you f'in' with, they don't know where you went
Then they won't find you until you are skeleton (Ooh)
They bite piranhas and stung by the jellyfish (Ooh, ooh)
These ain't no All-Stars, bitch, these is Vetements (Ooh)
Party time excellent, pardon my excellence (Yeah)
Pardon my necklace (Yeah), pardon my neck and wrist (Yeah)
Pardon my neckin' bitch (Yeah), all of my medicine
All I be askin' is, "Where the Promethazine?"
'Cause, pipe the fuck up (Yeah)
Yeah, don't make me hit you with that bow
Help, I've fallen, I can't get up
I live in dark, get rich or die tryin'
Like 50 Cent, minute man (Huh)
Wish death upon me, better wish again (Huh)
Don't shoot at Maaly G, he ain't listenin'
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, I tried to show him (Ayy)
I pull up in a Bugatti, for real
I pull up on the Ducati, one wheel (Vroom)
Then I take off on the private, the Lear
Up to the clouds until I disappear (Ayy)
Ain't where I live, it's about how I live (Ayy)
I'm outta here, me and my mama mia (Ayy)
I'm in that pussy, her ass, and it's fun
She shout in my ear, "It's Wayne's World"

[Chorus]
Party time excellent, I party hard (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I pull up in the Bugatti on God (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma make sure it's Wayne's World
Party time excellent, I party hard (Yeah, yeah)
I pull up in the Bugatti on God (Yeah, yeah)
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours" (Yeah, yeah)
I said, "Of course, it's Wayne's World" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Party time, excellent (Yeah, yeah)
Call the slimes, let's get lit (Yeah, yeah)
Party time, excellent (Yeah, yeah)
Totally, Wayne's World (Yeah, yeah)
Party time excellent, I party hard (Yeah, yeah)
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours," I wanted more
It's Wayne's World

[Verse 2]
Party time excellent, I party hard
I party hard even when times is hard
I just go hard, ain't no tomorrow
Party time excellent, harder than yesterday
I gotta medicate so I can resonate
That made me featherweight, so I can levitate
Into a better place, I don't care where you stay
Better, they better, but that's how you better stay, wait (Wait)
Who's that peekin' in my window, pow, nobody now (Pow)
Two, no buss downs, one bling-bling, one bling-blaow (Wow)
Just fucked my ex, don't know why, don't know how
Play with that XBOX all night like a child
Oh me, oh wow, baby, show me around
I said, "Show me your world," I said, "Now, show me out"
Yeah, laid on that bitch, I skate on that bitch
I wave to that bitch, I gave her a kiss
Can't give her my world, but I gave her the dick
Yeah, Wayne's World

[Chorus]
I pull up in the Bugatti on God (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Party time excellent, I party hard (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So I'ma make sure it's Wayne's World
Party time excellent, I party hard (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I pull up in the Bugatti on God (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I said of course, it's Wayne's World

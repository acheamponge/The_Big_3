[Verse 1]
What's good, brother?
Beat 'round the bush and I'ma come around with a bush cutter and look for you
You niggas talkin' too much shit
I'm about to find a good plumber
Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like "Bang, bang, bang, bang"
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9"
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid

[Bridge]
Your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I looped it
(Mama Mia)

[Verse 2]
I'm out of my Tunechi, I'm mindin' my Tunechi
I'm shinin' my Uzi
They find 'em, I lose 'em, I'm hidin' out
Hopin' I don't smell like all these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'
Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey
Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami
You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science
That's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai
You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti
Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em
Lil' Tunechi a shotta
Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

Motion picture shit, (Woo) at you with my .40 Glock
When I'm on my savage shit, bodies on that blacktop (Yeah)
Weapons in the stash box, (Yeah) keep a couple lamb chops (Yeah)
All we serve is hearses, you don't get no ambulance ride
All we know is big B's, yeah, you know, that's gang, gang
This ain't what you want, you don't wanna lose your brain, brain
Focused on this bag now, yeah we from the projects (Yeah)
We got that PTSD like some Vietnam vets
Miss me with that bullshit, I'm just tryna make a play
White Lamborghini truck, bitches call it yola-yay
Sharp as razor blades, Smith N' Wesson in my breakaway
Peep the different shit from behind these Aviator shades

Yellow pill, purple drank, I'm Laker geeked, mane
Drove off screamin', "Gang, gang"
Rose gold Richard Mille, nigga, plain Jane
Two twin Blickers, lil' nigga, ying-yang
Strong strong weed, lil' nigga, Ving Rhames
Big crown on, lil' nigga, Bing James (Bing James)
Bust down glowin' lil' nigga, Bling James (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Bling James)
Bust down froze, take a picture, freeze frame (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

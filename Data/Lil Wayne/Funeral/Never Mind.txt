[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad fish better than a veterinary
Never treat a secondary sweet as February
I could turn a bestie into a adversary
I tried, no, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Is it love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried

[Verse 1]
Thought I was done tryna love
I guess I love tryna love, hey
Not so careful, but today, I just don't care
Dye my hair
We so faded, we can't make it up my stairs
We fuck right there
Not so lucky, but tonight, I just crapped out
Vegas sucks, I'm still gambling with her, no protection
Protect what?
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows?
Nigga, not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad bitch better than a veterinary
Eat a bad bitch 'less she got that hairy, hairy
I could take her ex out of her vocabulary

[Chorus]
I, yeah got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
No, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 2]
We ain't no junkies, but today, we're like Snow White
Whatever we like, she don't judge me
Though I may need her to be the one to give me life
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Never mind

[Outro]
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind"

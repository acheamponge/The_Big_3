[Chorus]
I had a dream I was broke
No diamonds and no gold
Most saddest story ever told, oh
And I had a dream, I was a fool
No mansion or no pool
I woke up and I screamed
Thank God it was just a dream
Huh, huh, yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
I live the American dream, huh
Foreign everything, huh
I turn my scariest dreams, uh, into fairy wings
I don't want beef, I just want green, that's vegetarian dreams
Dream, dream, yeah
I'm havin' that dream where I'm fallin', yeah
I land in the purplest water, yeah
I'll probably surface tomorrow, yeah
Dream of a world with new order, yeah
It spin like the perfect revolver, yeah
I dreamt I died and went to Heaven and came back
'Cause I got work in the mornin', yeah
Yeah, yeah, sleep tight, yeah, I daydream all night
Keep my head up right, don't let the fed bugs bite
One night I fell asleep in some good pussy and I woke up like "Oh shit"
Had a dream that I was broke, I ain't sleep with that same ho since

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was broke
No diamonds and no gold (Yeah)
Most saddest story ever told, woah
And I had a dream, I was a fool (Yeah, yeah)
No mansion or no pool (No)
I woke up and I screamed
Thank God it was just a dream

[Verse 2]
We in another dimension (Yeah)
She say I'm the man of her dreams (Yeah)
So after I fuck her, I pinch her (Yeah)
She had the wettest of dreams (Yeah)
She gon' wake up in a swimsuit (Yeah)
They tryna sell me some dreams
Way too fuckin' expensive (Yeah)
I been sippin' all this lean, that's why my eyes are dreamy (Dreamy)
In my dream and I wake up, see all these fuckin' Weezys (Damn)
Mister Sandman, all your sand about to turn to cement (Damn)
California weed got me California dreamin' (Yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare

[Bridge]
I just wanna spend it all before I go to sleep (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Broke my heart and give it to you wrapped in 'chilla mink (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Waking up on the islands, OD's and violence (Yeah, yeah) (Yeah, yeah)
Roses with no thorns

[Chorus]
I had a dream, (I had a dream) I was broke
No diamonds and no gold (No diamonds)
Most saddest story ever told, oh (Woah)
And I had a dream, (I had a dream) I was a fool
No mansion or no pool (No, oh)
I woke up and I screamed
Thank God it was just a dream

[Post-Chorus]
Thank God it was just a dream
Thank God it was just a dream, yeah
Thank God it was just a dream
Thank God it was just a dream
Woke up and I screamed
Thank God it was just a dream

[Bridge]
I just wanna spend it all before I go to sleep
Broke my heart and give it to you wrapped in 'chilla mink
Woke up on islands, OD's and violence
Roses with no thorns (Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I just woke up with some new tattoos (Yeah, yeah)
I just woke up next to "Who is you and you and you?"
Got the groupie blue, woopty woo, hooty hoo
Make their dreams come true and then I put 'em back on snooze
Had a dream, I was a fool
No mansion or no pool (Yeah, yeah)
I woke up and I screamed...

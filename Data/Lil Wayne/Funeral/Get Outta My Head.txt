[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
The brains will start to abandon the religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Drop that motherfucker

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Narcissistic, insufficient, deadweight, I've been searchin' (Ayy)
Lack of coexistin', just don't seem to work with other bitches (No)
That's when black and white, when dark at night, that's when I do my searchin' (Ayy)
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind, the evolutions lurkin' (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got voices in my head, wild horses in my head
Runnin' around, horse playin'
Breakin' pots up in my head, waking corpses in my head
And they was better off dead
Runnin' faucets in my head, stompin', marchin' in my head
Sun is scorchin' in my head
Archie Bunker's in my head, talkin' bunkers in my head
Willy Wonka's in my head
All this junk is in my head, then it sunk into my head
Little monkeys in my head
Goin' bananas in my head, shootin' cannons in my head
Hittin' targets in my head
Playin' pianos in my head, keyboards, organs in my head
Smash guitars in my head
Fast cars in my head, with loud ass horns in my head
Horns stickin' out head

[Chorus: Lil Wayne with XXXTENTACION]
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (Yeah, yeah)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
All these voices in my head
They're committin' arson in my head
Real wars up in my head, crash courses in my head
Fightin' forces in my head, white noises soundin' red
All these voices in my head, all these thoughts up in my head
Like a spark plug in my head, like a torch up in my head
Ain't no shotguns in my head, all these sharks up in my head
All these sharks need to be fed (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4: XXXTENTACION, Lil Wayne, XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
I behead a motherfucker for his contacts (Behead a mothafucka)
Take the body where the others can't see (Can't see)
Seen the devil in my eyes without no contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, XXXTENTACION, Lil Wayne & XXXTENTACION]
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (The brains will start to abandon the religions)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (And believe in themselves)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (And the new world order will start)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (Yeah, yeah)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Grrr

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I did not come here to see who was litty
That stamp on the kilos say "key to the city"
Put some on my thumb and then I make her lick it
She can't feel her tongue, well, bitch, I beg to differ
I smoke gasoline and I sip down some lean
My whole tangerine on this dick, trampoline
I chop you up, they call them amputees
I spit these facts, they call me fax machine

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I drop a four in this, I'm feelin' glorious
Gun on Big Pun, and my clip on Notorious
Bitch, I'm the man, no, the Mandalorian
I'm in a DeLorean, nigga, I'm floorin' it
I got my whore in it, that bitch a foreigner
Pourin' her heart out, I'm just ignorin' her
I let my hair down, I'm finna go throw her
And bury myself in that pussy, no coroner
I can't smoke Reggie, I be too edgy
My bitch a veggie, bitch, I'm a legend
Pull out my flag, and these niggas start pledgin'
Go pull up whenever, we ain't gotta schedule it
Boy, I'm a president, presidential Rollie
Bezel it heavily, inspect it carefully
I'm smokin' like I'm in the Netherlands
Like I'm a hippie that's stuck in the 70s
You with your buddies, I'm with my bloodies
And this ain't no flag, lil' nigga, this rugby
Duct-tape that nigga up until he a mummy
Then put him in a freezer until we get hungry

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & O.T. Genasis]
Huh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go (Tell me where to go)
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope (No, no, no)
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow
Every time I'm O.T., my bitch cry like T.O. (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope (Steppin' on the dope)
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow (Eric with the snow)
Every time I'm O.T. (Yeah), my bitch cry like T.O.

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis, Lil Wayne, & Both]
Cookin' dope in kitchen, 36 (Yeah), I got chickens (Yeah)
Got the bowl (Yeah), I'ma whip it (Yeah)
Got the pistol (Yeah), get to clickin' (Woah)
Got the dope (Yeah), got the scope (Yeah)
Got the coke (Yeah) off the boat
Got the grams, make it float
Ask my plug, "What's the quote?" (Go)
I shoot at all of my enemies (Yeah)
Walk around like I'm Yosemite (Yeah)
Extra clip, that's my amenities (Aagh)
I'ma send shots like a Hennessy (Who? Bah, bah, bah)
Bitch, I'ma shoot like a penalty (Mm, bang)
Keep me a flag like a penalty (Bap, bang)
Niggas know me, O.T. (O.T.)
I got more hook than parentheses (Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah)
Home Depot, keep me a toolie (Toolie, brrt)
Walk in your house with a Uzi (Woo)
Walk in your room like a groupie (Yeah)
Wet your ass up with jacuzzi (Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah)
Everything white, I got Bieber
Cover one eye like I'm Aaliyah
Free Base, bitch, I got Derek Jeter
Rob, strip him naked, just like it's Peter
Bitch, bah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I did not come here to see who was litty
That stamp on the kilos say "key to the city"
Put some on my thumb and then I make her lick it
She can't feel her tongue, well, bitch, I beg to differ
I smoke gasoline and I sip down some lean
My whole tangerine on this dick, trampoline
I chop you up, they call them amputees
I spit these facts, they call me fax machine

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go (Tell me where to go)
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope (Steppin' on the dope)
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow (Eric with the snow)
Every time I'm O.T., my bitch cry like T.O. (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope, yeah (Steppin' on the dope, no, no, no, no)
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow (Eric with the snow)
Every time I'm O.T., my bitch cry like T.O. (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, "I said I've been lookin' for me"
I've been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
I've been lookin' at the cross and it just look like a T
Two fingers, I keep 'em crossed, I can't be lookin' for peace
I've been lookin' at the stars and they don't glisten for me
I've been lookin' in the mirror, he don't listen to me, sheesh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne]
If I die before I wake (Yeah)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take (Uh)
I lost count of my mistakes (Shit)
At least I learned along the way

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne, Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
And I don't trust nobody (Nobody), not my lovers, not my friends (Nobody)
I don't make no promises (No promises) 'cause I know just how they'll end
And I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
You gon' find a bunch of motherfuckers lookin' like me
I ain't ever lookin' back because the light always green
Safe to say I lost my way but I never lost the lead
Safe to say I lost the brakes but I never lost the speed
Wakey-wake, I lost some sleep but I never lost the dream
If you out there at the crossroads lookin' for me
You gon' find me with my eyes closed lookin' for grief

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne, Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
If I die before I wake (Yeah)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take (Uh)
I lost count of my mistakes
At least I learned along the way

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself, yeah

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, "I said I've been lookin' for me," fuck

[Intro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
Lil' mama not no thief, she not no thief

Yeah, hah
Tony

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Check the vernacular
It ain't no room, so she lapping up (Lap)
Shawty a Blood and I'm Dracula (Drac')
In a Tom Ford and I'm blacking up (Black)
In a Maybach and I'm backing up (Back)
Either protect or attackin' us (Uh)
I just might buy her a Acura (Uh)
Tell her to drive it to Africa (Damn)
This how a rich nigga take the trash out, but I'm not a janitor (Nah)
I'm an ex-drug dealer (Yeah)
Get a rush when the egg sizzle
Pocket full of dead people
She mine, I don't share people
If the feds watch me, they can see how many times I done fed people (Tell 'em)
I hit, but I can't date you, baby
You on the side like a baked potato
You look crazy, I don't wanna change you
If you a car, I would candy paint you
That's a bar, that's an indicator
Deep breath, hyperventilation
Shorty gon' share that throat (Throat)
She got the best, let's vote (Vote), yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And nigga, if you know your ho, that ho a ho
You know that ho gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat
If you know you know, that ho a ho
That ho is still gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, she still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shorty not a thief, but she steal a show, but she still a ho
I'ma need a million dollar bitch and a million more
She know I'm a million dollar nigga with a million hoes
Chillin' way up in my condominium on the millionth floor
She said that these niggas broke, they make her sick, she healing slow
She said she sick and tired of being sick and tired like Mystikal
I got cash from years ago, I ball 'til my Achilles tore
You say you stackin' money to the roof, lil' boy, your ceilings low
She been catching feelings though
She been all in my business like Siri though
I don't believe in no miracles
She swallow my bacterials
I fucked your ho, conduct your ho
If you don't believe it, there's video
That ain't your ho, that was your ho
She just a ho, she been a ho

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And nigga, if you know your ho, that ho a ho
You know that ho gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat
If you know you know, that ho a ho
That ho is still gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, she still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat

[Outro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
Lil' mama not no thief (She ain't no thief), not no thief
Steal a show, but she still a ho (Yeah), yeah
She steal a show, but she still a ho (Yeah)
I just might buy her a Acura (Uh)
Tell her to drive it to Africa (What?)

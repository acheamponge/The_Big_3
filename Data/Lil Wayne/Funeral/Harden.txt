[Intro]
No cap

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya

[Verse 1]
I know I ain't perfect
Got shit I need to work on, a nigga been workin'
I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless
I don't deserve ya, you don't deserve this
I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me they sorry, I said that make two of us
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral, goddamn

[Interlude]
(Love me or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn

[Verse 2]
Who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Since it ain't me, just tell lil' homie he lucky, I'm lonely for nothing
I'm starin' at the phone and the button to call 'em to come in
I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus]
(Love me), you must hate me (Or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn, Funeral

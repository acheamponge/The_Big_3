[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Taught my bitches how to whip it, now they whippin', fast learners
Chicken heads, whippin' chickens, I feel like a black colonel
Louis Vuitton, ballin' like Mr. Kareem Abdul-Jabaar
Saint Laurent, I been had the green light, I blew the horn
C'mon c'mon, fuck we waitin' on, my nigga? Move along
Grass is greener on the other side, I never do the lawn
Deepest water, Cita Carter made me feel like Peter Parker
Be a Dora, double R her, treat her like a Ford Explorer
See no evil, neither horror, my bitch eyes chinky, Kamora
Run a mile like Jackie Joyner, bitch should go read a thesaurus
Pretty Tony, Pretty Ricky, Ricky Martin, Martin Lawrence
Lawrence Taylor, Taylor Swift, tailor-made, made in China
Black Chyna, Black Mamba, baby mama, Lady Gaga
Wait, Rihanna, ball hard, Sinéad O'Connor, hm

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
It's MULA baby, know you heard me, got the game, I'm talkin' early
Twizzy baby, got these bitches swallowin' babies, talkin' nurseries
Pocket pull up, Black Eyed Peas, the P from Perc has got me flirty
Model bitches tryna hurt me, broken mirrors, pull a Fergie
Oh my God, it's cocaina, Kim and Gina had to team up
Tried to run 'way from this dick and got subpoenaed, had to clean up
Got two strikes out in L.A., I get one more, then new Adidas
Niggas call me Hustle Westbrook, sellin' dope off in the bleachers
Niggas call me Hustle Westbrook, sellin' dope off in the bleachers
Trappin' off a walkie-talkie, ten-four, over, yeah, I read you
That my woadie, that my 'migo, gettin' loaded off sativa
Move the rock like Russell Westbrook, triple-double the whole season, woah

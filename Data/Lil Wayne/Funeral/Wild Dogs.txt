[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
Bitch, I'm, bitch, I'ma ball and...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I feel just like Russell Westbrook
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I feel just like Russell Westbrook
Bitch, I'm a dog, I turn to a werewolf
Got Siri fuckin' Alexa
Me and my dawgs pull up in a Tesla
I'ma bust down the Perpetual
Look at it too hard, it's gon' bust your retina
With diamonds that's covered like eczema
Me and my dawgs don't fuck with the rest of 'em
Don't fuck with the rest of 'em
Me and my dawgs don't fuck with the rest of 'em
We treat 'em like veterinarians
Me and my dawgs pull up in a Tesla
I'ma bust down the Perpetual
Look at it too hard, it's gon' bust your retina
With diamonds that's covered like eczema
Me and my dawgs don't fuck with the rest of 'em
We treat 'em like veterinarians
Me and my dawgs, we come to your area
We gon' go hard just like DMX and them (Ruff)

[Verse 1]
Fresh out the pad, boy, bitch, I'm a hot boy
Red ass dot, boy, duh-duh-duh-dot boy
Shoot every spot, boy, back, chest, top, boy
Shoot out like cowboys, Dak Prescott, boy
Percs get popped, boy, yes I'm a hostage
Xanny get popped too, that's for my conscience
Addy get popped too, now I'm a zombie
Muscle relaxant, that's for my posture
I'ma do acid, now I'm obnoxious
Sip cotton candy, pop Oxycontin
Hold you for ransom, now you the hostage
Call up your family, give 'em the options
Tell 'em to cash it, put 'em in boxes
Do not deal with 12 'cause you dealin' with monsters
If everything fail, then we killin' your mama
We all go to Hell but right now we on fire
I'm talkin' that shit, yeah
And I'm walkin' that shit like a dog in this bitch
That's your dawg, he a bitch, yeah
He was barkin' and shit, now he eatin' his words
Tell him gargle and spit, don't be startin' no shit
When you start up in this, put your heart in my fist
Squeeze your heat 'til it squish, then I wash and not rinse
Give your daughter a kiss, then we slaughter that bitch

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
Bitch, I'm, bitch, I'ma ball and...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I feel just like Russell Westbrook
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I, I feel just like Russell Westbrook
Bitch, I'm a dog, I turn to a werewolf
Got Siri fuckin' Alexa
Me and my dawgs pull up in a Tesla
I, I'ma bust down the Perpetual
Look at it too hard, it's gon' bust your retina
With diamonds that's covered like eczema
Me and my dawgs don't fuck with the rest of 'em
Me and my dawgs don't...
Me and my dawgs don't fuck with the rest of 'em
We treat 'em like veterinarians
Me and my dawgs pull up in a Tesla
I'ma bust down the Perpetual
Look at it too hard, it's gon' bust your retina
With diamonds that's covered like eczema
Me and my dawgs don't fuck with the rest of 'em
We treat 'em like veterinarians
Me and my dawgs, we come to your area
We gon' go hard just like DMX and them (Ruff)

[Verse 2]
Woah
All my dawgs gon' slide, yeah
Bust up in your home, yeah
Home sweet homicide, yeah
All my dawgs is wild niggas, saw your dawg goodbye, yeah
Pet Sematary, I got all your dawgs inside, yeah
Yeah, y'all done lost your mind, yeah
And all my stars aligned, yeah
So all my dawgs gon' shine, yeah
All my dawgs is slimes, yeah
It's war like Vietnam, yeah
Throw that dog a bone, wait...
That might be a bomb, damn

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
Bitch, I'm, bitch, I'ma ball and...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I feel just like Russell Westbrook
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever

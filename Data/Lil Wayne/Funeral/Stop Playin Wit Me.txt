[Intro]
(Chill Stump on the beat)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a plus sized model
But she my lil' mama
I make her bust it open for me like a piñata
And as the world turned, she was my spin doctor
'Cause when I was down, you all got lost on me like Bin Laden
I know that times changed, I don't think I've changed
I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games
Baby, stop playin' with me
Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me
Shit is so embarrassing, low-key flattering
They'd rather battle royale, way before they battle me
Long live my skateboard and rest in peace to Adam Z
Motherfucker, stop playin' with me

[Chorus]
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, it's been a long time
For a long time
Time sure flies but it's on a long flight
No I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well bitch, it's game time
And you gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I've been feelin' like a killer since the diapers
I've been feelin' like a hitter since the minors
Sticky icky like a itsy bitsy spider
They say to be or not to be, bitch, I'm indecisive
I'm in the buildin' like the interior designer
You in your feelings like a bitch when she get her cycle
Ain't that a bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm yellin', "Please don't wife her"
Dwayne Carter, niggas wanna be the DC sniper
Well, fuck it, I'm thuggin' on the low, I'm ballin' on the high
I'm fuckin' on the floor, she can crawl but can't hide
I'm Bloodin' with my bros, goin' hard with my slimes
It ain't nothin' to a GOAT but the roar of a lion
Jungle book, ho, it's another book show
No car keys needed, button push, go
We gon' ghost ride in the whip, then she believe in ghosts
I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow
Put my foot down in this bitch, these niggas twinkle toes
Nigga, sit down, you a bitch, I heard your seat unfold
Way up in the nosebleeds, hold your head back, squeeze your nose

[Outro]
Nigga, stop playin' with me
Stop playing with me
It's been a long time, a long time
Long, long time since she loved me long time
Told her stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me
No, I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well then it's game time
You gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch
Yes, I've been on time, for a long time
And time sure flies, but it's on a long flight
And you gon' stop playin' with me, yeah

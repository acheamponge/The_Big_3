[Chorus]
Now who gon' pop me?
Who gon' pop me?
Bunch of niggas in here lookin' like, "Not me"
Bunch of lookin' ass niggas I do not see
Got my slimes in this bitch and they got me
Bunch of niggas with me lookin' like, "Copy"
Bunch of lookin' ass bitches tryna watch me
No Itachi
Bitch, I'm rollin' like my nigga on Degrassi
Now who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Bunch of niggas in here lookin' like, "Not me" (Yeah)
Yes, I'm stuntin' on these niggas, let the opps see (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Put some money on my head, but your shooter missed
But you know karma is a bitch just like you a bitch
Walked in the pet store said, "Get me a cobra"
Gotta keep your friends close, enemies closer
You know wifey from Australia, she said, "Cheers, mate"
Then we toast and see how you niggas' tears taste
Mix the soda and codeine, that's a mixtape
And if you hatin', come and say it to my dick face
But who the fuck want war? No one so far
Two cups, no straw, bustdown Chopard
Smoke medicinal 'cause I'm sick
I'm 5'5", them Balencis make me 5'6"
It's my shit, nigga, smell that
I'm in the Koenigsegg, nigga, spell that
Where they sell that?
I'm goin' turbo, yeah
Stompin' on a nigga turf 'til I get turf toe, yeah
Heard you got your own wave, no surfboard, damn
Told her, "Give me dirty head, no shampoo"
I like my blunt Remy thick, no capoose
Talkin' shit and it taste like apples
Fuck rappers

[Chorus]
Now who gon' pop me?
Who gon' pop me? (Huh)
Who gon' pop me? (Huh)
Bunch of niggas in here lookin' like, "Not me"
Bunch of lookin' ass niggas tryna spot me
Who gon' pop me? (Huh)
Now who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Full tank, I'm on F, 'bout to pop E
Bunch of bitches lookin' at me like I'm Papi
I say, "Aquí"

[Verse 2]
Okay, who gon' pop me? (Huh? Huh?)
You not poppin' (Huh?)
My drip droppin', nigga, you gon' mop it
Get your popcorn, nigga, I've been poppin' since Pop Warner
Nigga, I pop up and Pop-Tart a nigga, what's poppin'? (What's poppin'?)
Yeah, Uzi on my seat (Huh?)
Money on my mind, so I usually overthink
Yeah, I'm runnin' out of time, so I bought another Rollie
Once upon a time, that's the moral of the story
You're a Cookie Monster (Yeah), lookin' at a goblin (Yeah)
Got a pussy popper (Yeah), I call her Mary Poppins (Ooh)
I got a few choppers (Yeah), I like to have my options
If you a goon, nigga, I'm a balloon, nigga

[Chorus]
Now who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Bunch of niggas in here lookin' like, "Not me" (Huh?)
Bunch of lookin' ass niggas I do not see (Huh?)
Got my slimes in this bitch and they got me (Yeah)
Bunch of niggas with me lookin' like, "Copy" (Woo)
Bunch of bitches lookin' at me like Papi (Woo)
I say, "Grazie" (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm rollin' like my nigga on Degrassi (Yeah)
Now who gon' pop me?
Who gon' pop me? (Huh?)
Who gon' pop me? (Huh?)
Bunch of niggas in here lookin' like, "Not me"
Bunch of lookin' ass niggas tryna spot me
Who gon' pop me? (Uh)
Now who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Who gon' pop me? (Yeah)
Full tank, I'm on F, 'bout to pop E
Bunch of bitches lookin' at me like I'm Papi
I say, "Aquí"

[Outro]
Ain't gon' roll up, I'ma pop up (Uh)
And get you popped up (Uh)
Ain't no tellin' where your body might pop up
Ain't gon' pull up, I'ma pop up
And get you popped up
But ain't no tellin' where your body might pop up
Who the fuck want war? (Who the fuck want war?)
Who the fuck want war? (Who the fuck want war?)

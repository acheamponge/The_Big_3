[Verse 1]
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker
Girl, take that cash from them ball players
Yeah, let me see you make that pussy open-close
For some Gucci open-toes and some OVOs
I hit it like a bullet hole, leave that pussy swole
You lookin' like a pot of gold on that silver pole
Clap, encore, pussy lips drum roll
Make the pearl tongue go rrrrrrrrrr
Round of applause, make a round of applause
Bounce for your boy, up and down, bungee cord
One cheek at a time, girl, you asinine
Left, right, right, left, girl, I can't decide
Uh, bae just got off work, lemme pop a Perc'
Garbage bag full of ones, don't know what she worth
I'ma fuck her 'til she squirt, then she go to church
Clap it like a choir

[Chorus]
Oh, yes, hoes
Make that ass clap like a round of applause
Make that ass clap like a round of applause
Make that ass clap like a round of applause
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Take, take that cash, hold up (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass, hold up (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)

[Bridge]
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker
She just got a fake ass, it be soft later
Don't take that trash from them heart-breakers
Take, take that cash (Jahlil beats, holla at me!)

[Chorus]
Hold up, shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Okay (Make that ass...)

[Verse 2]
Wobble-di-wobble, lil' mama ass is colossal
Give me head like a bobblehead, bobble-di-bobble
And she gobble and gargle and swallow until I'm hollow
She gon' do it for the culture, then go viral and viral (Woo)
Viral and viral, ooh, viral and viral
Pull that grande out my pants and grind it like Ariana
Grind it like Ariana, grind it like marijuana
I make her holla like a virgin Madonna, go soprano
Call me Kurt Cocaine, wilin' like I'm Nirvana
I eat it like a piranha, she got a tongue like iguana
She wear her hair like E. Honda, a birthday suit for pajamas
I'm only here 'til mañana, she say no habla España
I say for sh-sure, make that shit go pa-pa-pa-pa like my pistol
Bitch, go sicko on my pickle, my lollipop, my popsicle
This YM, ho, and it been, ho, I been poppin' since my demo
Shout out Pluto
This that N.O., make that ass clap like some cymbals, ow
Rrrrrrrrr

[Chorus]
Oh, yes, hoes
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
She just got a fake ass, it be soft later (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass, hold up (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass, hold up (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass like a salt shaker (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
She just got a fake ass, it be soft later (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass, hold up (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)
Shake, shake that ass (Make that ass clap like a round of applause)

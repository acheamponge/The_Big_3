[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
I put piss stains on private planes, cause it's my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my Rottweilers drink Moët
Diamond baguette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost three nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got a Benz, a Prowler, playboy, and a 'Vette
Tell the truth -- who fucked you on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the N.O. to New York
Who got every bitch's attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking about, look -- y'all dont know?
I'll give you a hint: see that bitch you with?
He fucked that ho
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, it's like 'Harlem World' video
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know
Shorty, when the next time I'mma be up in your bed
I love you? You love me?
Well go 'head on and gimme some head

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

[Verse 2: Baby]
I told 'Soul' I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing, these hoes doing hella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20-inch chrome
Give me the key, the car, ho, and the alarm
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20-inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the chopper's mine
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Bought it to tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the VC's and TV's so a nigga could shine
Let my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

[Verse 3: B.G.]
I ride the best, from a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a repper, Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moët, and Crissy, see that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring yo bitch around me cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different, that's your issue
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her
Whole city sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at B.G. watch, that bitch bling-a-ling-a-ling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 G's or better
Me and Wayne take the left, Juve and Baby take the right
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light
Cash Money Millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga Weezy said, we surrounded by ice

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Now I'm shinin' beamin' glossin', Big Tymin' stuntin' and flossin'
Lamborghini sitting on broaders with two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari with Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome, vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em
I'm back, I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the Hummer, hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jet's about to land
The women fall out when I let them touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20-inch fans, damn
Goddamn, man, I am, L-I-L, Weezy, off the heezy
But still in awe, ice floodin' on my watch
And in my grill and all, Porsche Box', front blocks
Skrrt! Peeling off, me and Slim in the Rover
Beatrice brick holder, Cash Money young soldier

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

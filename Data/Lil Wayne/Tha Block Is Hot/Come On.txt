[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Where my niggas at, it's play it raw time baby
Load up the guns guerilla war time baby
Light up the blunts, light up the block time dawg
Choppers with drums, uzi's, and Glock time dawg
Murk Whoever he with, they better split cause this the night
And whoever ain't hit, jump out the whip and get it right
Then we run in his house, see anybody and haul them out
Then we empty the clips and let the Lord sort em out
I'm bustin it really, it ain't no stopping me cause I hang up to that Dilly
And now I'm tying up my bandanna and I'm cocking back
Jump out the Hummer send a hundred to your stocking cap
Dawg we got automatics, two shooters, six shots, and 50 round drums
Hit your daddy, you sister, your son, your wife and move your momma
Cause I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
Got a sawed off, tec and I'm bout to knock off your brain
Tell em'

[Chorus: B.G. & Lil Wayne]
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!

[Verse 2: B.G.]
If drama come to me then it come
For that I got two Glocks and a k with a drum
That's what I ride with not what I got got ducked off
The mac, sweeper, the six shot, pump that sawd off
I got the tillery when beef kick
I got soldiers ready to march when that beef start
I got niggas be in that zone on that herion
I got niggas ready to kill when shit get real
I got niggas that play all out skirts of the field
So get caught up in that place and your brain get spilled
Oh it's a game but it's a game of life or death
You lose and can't continue if you get dome checked
You get blues it's all what duck gonna be next
Come in that water and get wet
Think you can fuck with me, your thoughts will get upset
I don't shot to hit I shot to kill
Believe me I don't shoot for fun when I shoot it's for real
Come on nigga!

[Chorus: B.G. & Lil Wayne]
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Give me the guns, I'm ready to bust one nigga
My nuts hung nigga, since I was young nigga
I get dumb nigga, with the M-1 nigga
I sip some nigga, and I flip some nigga
Imma uptown stunna, what the hell you think
Ready for war, but I ain't captain of no goddamn tank!
And you can take that to vegillity boy
I'm burning up, I'm on fire is you smelling boy
Cause I be coming with the top down
Letting them know how the chop sound
100 rounds tore the whole entire block down
Assault rifle with a drum and beam totter
38 with a speed loader in my holster
Mac uzi achine with a strap around my shoulder
But if I pop my trunk I'm might just set off a damn explosion
I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
Got a sawed off tec and I'm bout to knock off your brain
Tell em'

[Chorus: B.G. & Lil Wayne]
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
You ain't gotta hollar wodie, here I come nigga!
You ain't gotta hollar wodie, here I come nigga!

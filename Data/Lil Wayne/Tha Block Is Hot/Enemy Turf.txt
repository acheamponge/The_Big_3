[Intro: Juvenile]
Ah hmmm hmmmm
Hmmmm Hmmm

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
When I say I don't give a fuck
I mean that yeah
Niggas brains is gettin bust
I don' seen that yeah
If a shipment was comin in
I need a haul of dat wodie
I need a sixty-forty nigga
And no chargin' that wodie
You done heard about Michael Jackson
And shiggidy shit
But you ain't never heard about me
When I'm flissin a bitch
Niggas doors gettin knocked
Clean off of the hinge
See that red dot comin for
Me and my girlfriend?
Cause I wants mine
I needs mine
And I'm about to get mine
But these dying
Look lil' daddy
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all
Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aight?

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy

[Interlude: Lil' Wayne]
My big brother Juvi
Both hit tha blocks
Strapped up with the Uzis

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What, What, La
Gun for gun
Eye for eye
Better move yo' wife and son
Cause I ride or die
Cash Money Hot Boy, bless me when I'm gone
But until then, load up the chrome, cause it's on
I been bout it
Put a boot up in my lip and put my thirty up in a clip
I drop the top and then I dip I hit his block and make 'em flip
And I be full of that trash
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast
Watch the bullets chop off the head
And make 'em fall in the grass
One move they all die
Lil Weezy a small fry, but gorilla when it's war time
Y'all better learn
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
Hold 'em fo' ransom, hear me smart boy
Seven churn and I be damn if I let 'em go
If I don't get my dough
Then hell will be all blowin'
Til I R.I.P., C.M.B. I be
I put it down for all my peeps
Nigga, I'm H.B. for real

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
All I know is the streets
And how to strap up
When it's time shoot it
Cock yo' heaters
Tie up yo' bags
It's time to do it
Blaze the blunt
Shut off the lights
And cut down the music
Roll down the windows
Turn the corner
And let loose with the bbbbrrrrrr
If ya don't know now
Then ya never will learn
You can play with Lil' Wayne
And yo' block get burned
You must love to go swimmin
Cause tha water gets deeper
See I bust you wide open
And take 'ya daughter with me
Here come the beat boy
Shoot out the street lights
Time to bring on the heat boy
If you ain't really wit it
Then you better get back
I open yo' chest
And make it look just like a wet cat
This is a death trap
I'mma a guerilla and I mean it
Leave ya' head still in a beanin'
Lyin' on the cement
Calicoe steamin'
Red dot beamin', dressed up suspicious
Play with Lil Weezy, you'll be dinner for the fishes

[Chorus: Juvenile & Lil Wayne]
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy
It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy

[Outro]
Enemy Turf
Time to strap up
What

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
What what what
What what what
What what what
Listen, listen

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When I come through bustin'
Everybody on the block be runnin'
Weezy Wayne, Hot Boy, I be thuggin'
Got them things, ten a key, hustlin'
Catch me at tha shop, I will.. be.. there
And my prices stay low, I keep.. it.. there
And if you want it raw, I got.. it.. right.. here
And if you want war, I am.. your.. nigh-tmare
This is all I know, it's gang bang
I hustle and slang slang
My block.. I hang hang
Who am I? Lil' Wayne, man
I represent CMB
My sell is ten a key
I usually get in beef
Was taught that it's him or me
I pop at bustas quick
I rock half of a brick
I chop that, Dominic's
My shop here by the vic's
I always.. thug in black
And always.. bustin' gats
Your girl legs.. pumpin' back
Now how you... lovin' that?

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Hot Boys wodie, respect us
Representin' Team Cash-Money Re-cords
It's warfare, you betta, vest up
But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up
Hot Boys wodie, respect us
Representin' Team Cash-Money Re-cords
It's warfare, you betta, vest up
But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Listen, listen
I give it to 'em how they ask me
Raw and nasty
Tha AK, I pack it
Believe I'm 'bout that action
Slash a busta like a fraction
I'm on that yolla
Standin' on tha corner with one sleeve over my shoulder
Ride on your block, I see a dozen of weak jerks
Now it's time for your momma to order a dozen of T-shirts
For only half-a brick
I'll blast tha fifth
And I ain't gon' stop shootin' 'til I jam tha clip
Yeah, I'm a small creeper, what
But it's about to get ugly
Ya'll betta call people up
I'm about ta start shovin' my sawed-off between your guts
Wayne 'bout to (cugghh-gghh-gghh) ball people up
Ya'll betta duck
When it get real, they hide from me
But, all them bustas 'bout ta get killed, I'm tired of it
Man, I'm thuggin' 'til the day I-I die, cousin
Weezy Wee, let 'em burn, bring the fire truck in (Whoop!)

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Hot Boys wodie, respect us
Representin' Team Cash-Money Re-cords
It's warfare, you betta, vest up
But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up
Hot Boys wodie, respect us
Representin' Team Cash-Money Re-cords
It's warfare, you betta, vest up
But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, let it be known
I'll come blow up your home
Take a few blunts to tha dome
And.. show up alone
Just me and my.. flame-torch
Wayne start.. danger
Walked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya
Burnin' off that Hennesy
Some-a ya'll be feminine
Bounce in with a twitch
Leave 'em crawlin' out a ditch
God damn... son of a shhh!.. Don't speak
I cocked that, and let it go, tssss!.. Give 'em heat
Your cheese, I got.. ta.. get.. paid
I'm goin' all out, no matter what.. it.. takes
I.. was.. raised.. up on.. that.. paper
Kill-for-the-scrill was.. in.. my.. nature
Tote M1's and keep.. tha.. block.. hot
Sell raw coke to keep.. my.. Glock.. hot
Never add taxes to.. my.. price, man
And if a boy play, I ride.. at.. night, man
What!

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Hot Boys wodie, respect us
Representin' Team Cash-Money Re-cords
It's warfare, you betta, vest up
But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up
Hot Boys wodie, respect us
Representin' Team Cash-Money Re-cords
It's warfare, you betta, vest up
But if you ain't scared, then throw your sets up

[Outro: Juvenile]
Uh, uh, uh
Say Lil' Weezy
You did this one here, ya heard me
They ain't gon' never get well from this one
It's like they said, boy
In tha year 2000, it's all about Wayne
It's your throne, man, run that thang
17th ward to tha 3rd ward downtown
Do that there
Huh, huh, huh, huh

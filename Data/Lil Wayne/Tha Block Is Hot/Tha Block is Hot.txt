[Intro: Lil' Wayne]
Wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, what

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight off the block, gold nuts in my hand, trustin' no man
Got my Glock cocked, runnin' this thing, ya understand
We be steamin', blazin', nines, pumps and K's and
Hollygrove 17th the hood where I was raised in (what, what, what)
Niggas bustin' heads and, runnin' duckin' Feds and (what)
Rocks under they tongues and, ki's under they beds and
Hood fulla real niggas, twenty-four seven hustlers
(Ughhh) Until we shove a barrel down ya pipe suckers
Ain't no love for no busta, no fear for no coward
No respect for no slut, and no money without power
We keepin' niggas hotter, ughhh, nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and "blocka" at every hour
Some niggas like that powder, foldin' up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins (oh)
From the home of that 'caine, jackin' and crackin' brains
Broadcastin' live from Tha Block, it's Lil' Wayne (who it is?)

[Chorus: Juvenile, (B.G.) & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (Well cook something, nigga)
Nigga, you let them K's go? (Well bust somethin, nigga)
Are you duckin' that law? (You better run from 'em, nigga)
Are you playin' with that raw? (Well won't you front somethin', nigga)
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
See where I'm from we keep our guns out
Dodgin' cops and burnin' blocks so we be thugged out
It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halfs and birds in that one house (I got it, I got it)
It's all good in the hood hustlin' like it's legal
Soon as you get it, hot (skrrt!) there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Ms. Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggas murder off top, boy
It's the spot where they got fire girls and hot boys
We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day 'til we "400 Degreez"
And you see when it get dark, nobody be on the porch
They got a nigga got on a scarf, he flippin' out off that raw
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure (*beep beep*) your door is locked
'Cause this ain't nothin' proper, 'cause Tha Block issss hot

[Chorus: Juvenile, (B.G.) & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (Well cook something, nigga)
Nigga, you let them K's go? (Well bust somethin, nigga)
Are you duckin' that law? (You better run from 'em, nigga)
Are you playin' with that raw? (Well won't you front somethin', nigga)
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
See watch your step on my set, gotta walk like, talk like
We done shot out all the street lights, so you can't see who we be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggas been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin' with cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hahhhh, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggas that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin' weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up, put em in the vans then put a gat in his jaws
One move blow his cactuses off

[Chorus: Juvenile, (B.G.) & Lil' Wayne]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (Well cook something, nigga)
Nigga, you let them K's go? (Well bust somethin, nigga)
Are you duckin' that law? (You better run from 'em, nigga)
Are you playin' with that raw? (Well won't you front somethin', nigga)
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha, ha-ha
Tha Block is hot, Tha Block is hot, ha

[Outro: Lil' Wayne]

Nigga ch-shhhhh, cook it up, 'cause Tha Block is hot
Say look daddy, just hook it up, 'cause Tha Block is hot
Nigga WHOOT! Some people call me 'cause Tha Block is hot

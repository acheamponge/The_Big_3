[Intro: Lil Wayne & B.G.]
Say Weezy (Whats Hannin?)
Can they remember me?
Lil Weezy
Make 'em remember (Haaa!) ya, nigga
Let these niggas know your (Look!) background, nigga (Look!)
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background!
Let 'em know how you've been thuggin

[Verse 1]
All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Grind and struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress
Them niggas there with big Willy
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my braids
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggas play, they get drenched
My pockets is full of lint
So, nigga, stay off the bend, I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed
So Ion even hesitate to leave 'em on tha curb
And wet them niggas shirt, nigga, get 'em for them birds
Tell them niggas, Geezy!

[Chorus: B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

[Verse 2]
Look, look
At times I forgot tha bills
Ain't been home in two weeks
Macita lookin' for me
Tha word all over tha streets
Well, shiiit! I love my momma
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems
I lay back in tha cut
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here
The lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow
I can't see it, I don' dropped my pile on tha floor
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders
*gun cocks* Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)
Well, picture this, I gotta call from this ole' nigga Beatrice
He said he got that work, and needed me to make it happen (Make it happen)
Well Nigga, shit you hold it down when something shakin, daddy (What?)
Within a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)
Oh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)
Cowards start hollerin' cause (Weezy) they know I'm comin' for it

[Chorus: B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

[Verse 3]
Lemme tell 'em
You remember that there nigga use to be thuggin' it out (Out!)
Blunt in his mouth, would stayed masked up in the drought
Run in your house, "Lay down! Nobody move! (Move!)
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs... make niggas count the ants in the mud
Some niggas choose ta come back for me, ride around my set for me
Might start jackin' because I got that SKS with me
!Okay! (!okay!)
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)
Cause, see, ya'll got it
I gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)
And Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin'... week for week
No-sleep livin'
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin'
I'm ready to sweep these niggas
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!

[Chorus: B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

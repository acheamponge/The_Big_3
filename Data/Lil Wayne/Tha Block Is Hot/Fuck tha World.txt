[Intro]
Look, look, look

[Verse 1]
A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin ride
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and Glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads they tryna get me stomped keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waistline
Duckin the law, cause I ain't tryna' do no Fed time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Ginae and keep Ms. Cita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

[Verse 2]
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The Feds said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And whole family deny me of what I do cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin' away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin' but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

[Verse 3]
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'mma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all'a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

[Chorus]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

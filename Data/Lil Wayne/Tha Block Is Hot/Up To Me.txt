[Verse 1]
Look, where I go from here?
Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm comin man
Just wait at the gates, I'mma be runnin man
Arms open, eyes wide, full of love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son ridin every day on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And Cita; Ms. Rose, Sheryl, Kevin, and plus Senitra
Dawg, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool livin off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me

[Chorus: Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)

[Verse 2]
Alright I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dawg, thangs got wild
I know you probably sayin 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin millions now
So I still smile
I'm takin care ya wife brah
Ain't nothin changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who payin the bills now, ah hah
Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah
I got all my game from you, nigga I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thuggin nigga, playa you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, Hummers and Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me

[Chorus: Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)

[Verse 3]
I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me everytime, watchin yo' lil boy shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me
And I'mma prove it, and show ya daddy, it's up to me

[Chorus: Turk & (Lil Wayne)]
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
It's up to you, Wayne, (I know) nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everythang gon' be alright (Alright Dog)
I know it's hard tryna make it but it's gon' be alright (Alright Dog)

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Turk]

[Intro]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, oh me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker, yeah!

[Chorus]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Post-Chorus]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (haha!)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

[Chorus]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants (haha!)
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker (yeah) and a bit of a drinker (hey!)

[Post-Chorus]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 2]
Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble, better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (listen mayne)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Bridge]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

[Chorus]
And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name...
As it is, shawty

[Intro]
Up up and away
Up up and away
Up, up up and away
Up, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm about to go, up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, mmm, how sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy, bitch, I'm deeper than space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone, like delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I'll bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Hook]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where ya going? (Up)
You're going a little bit too far

[Verse 2]
Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Hook]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where you going? (Ha)
You're going a little bit too far (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away

[Verse 3]
Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightning struck that nigga
Racks on deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm calling my bitch the shit
Walking around on my fuck it shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a Hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Interlude]
Weezy, where you going?
You're going a little bit too far
(Up up and away)

[Outro]
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Come here, I might need you
You're gonna have to tickle me or something
I need to smoke a cigarette

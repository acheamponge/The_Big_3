[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 1]
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today I took a walk outside and...

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 2]
Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cause promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker, I don't shoot ya; bitch, I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee, nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside and...

[Chorus]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

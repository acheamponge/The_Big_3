[Intro: John Legend]
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, "You're Very Welcome" I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night, uh
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
So special

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, thinking bout you girl got my mind on E
You know them other niggas ain't me
Girl I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya
I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now shes on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

(Girl I got that 12 play for ya)
(So special girl, so special to me)

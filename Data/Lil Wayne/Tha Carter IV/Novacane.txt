[Intro]
Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the World
Sorry I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor prefered
My Friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad our thing had to end
The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long
And I see her in the streets
But I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Hah. No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is...

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left it for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time, cause

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 1]
Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain't for "Flaw"

[Interlude]
Uh, uh
Yep, yep
Yep, yep

[Verse 2]
It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me "Sir," call me "Survivor"

[Interlude]
Uh, yeah
Uh, haha
And they go "yep, yep"
Yep, yep

[Verse 3]
Uh, call me "Killer" 'cause I make a killin'
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the "F" is for "Fuck yourself"

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain’t for "Fear," uh

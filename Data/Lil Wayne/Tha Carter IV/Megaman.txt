[Verse 1]
Faded off the Kush, I'm gone
Only two years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home
Looking like my grandma, my niggas got that ammo
We jack-son and then light up the L, Samuel
Tunechi in this bitch, nigga, y'all niggas bitch niggas
Rats gon' rat, and snakes gon' hiss, nigga
Baseball rich nigga, do this shit for all my homies
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that pussy on me
Tunechi, you a murderer, boy, you just be killing shit
Yeah, you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep, man
Birdman Junior, got the world in my wingspan
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
I get deep in that pussy, dig her out, surgery
Fucking with a real nigga, fucking right, certainly
Break in your fucking home, take your life, burglary
Whoa, nigga, die slow, nigga
For dear life you're holding on, En Vogue, nigga
Unload, nigga, reload, nigga
Tools on deck, Home Depot, nigga
Well, if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger
Yeah, and all my bitches nasty like a cold dinner
Everyday, I go so hard and work my ass off
I'm good, I'm 100 like a fastball
It's Carter IV

[Interlude]
Yeah!
Ugh!
I'm going back in, man
Yeah

[Verse 2]
We get fuck y'all money, how you wanna play it?
That AK sleep on the side of my bed
That's one eye closed, one eye open
Your cap get peeled like ibuprofen
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to fuck with
It's a crazy world, and life is shorter than Bushwick
Young Money, man, we got this shit by a land slide
Boy, I send them Bloods at your ass like a tampon
Uptown shit, wet the whole party
Weezy gon' ball, bal' like Steve Harvey
The heater I'ma tuck her, Tuck-er like De-lores
That's my word, word like the-saurus
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard
Rap game dependent on me like a bungee cord
Fear nobody, but God almighty
Shoot that motherfucker till I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it, I paint a picture vivid
And them pistols popping like they sitting in a skillet
I go so hard, go so mean, I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge I couldn't budge, it was him or me
Forget the bullshit and remember me

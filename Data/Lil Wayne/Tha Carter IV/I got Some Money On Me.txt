[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I don’t be politicin', I’m not political
Fuck you talkin' about? bitch I’m Kenneth Cole
My goons masked up, Rey Mysterio
Bitch, eat somethin', I don’t like skinny hoes
I hit her from the back, she on her tippy toes
I smoke that Green Day, I’m on my Billie Joe
I’m a dog bitch: B-I-N-G-O
I’m a rich ass nigga, you bitch ass nigga
I’m from the school of Hard Knocks, you skipped class nigga
Tell her bust that pussy open, bend it over bring it back
Get some brain out that ho and call that ho a "brainiac"

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
Fuck you talkin' about? bitch I’m Kenny Cole
I’m a dog bitch: bingo
Every bad bitch love me, I’m Young Money
Tell em pop that pussy for me, pop that pussy for me
And my niggas got the guns, they're aimin' at your skully
Tell them: "pop that pussy for me"
Pop that pussy for me !

[Birdman]
Uptown gangsta life, made man, 5 star nigga
Ya understand me, give a hundred and hundreds

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
If you a bad bitch, say "fuck them other hoes!"
I’m in my lane bitch, you a gutter bowl
Boogers in the watch, it got a runny nose
I like a pink pussy, just like a bunny nose
And we are Young Money, the untouchables
I hit her from the back, I make her touch her toes
I’m on that drink baby, I think I’m comotosed
I’m feelin' real good, Stevie Wonder-ful
And everybody with me strapped, tell them hoes adapt
Shoot ‘em in his head, he dead before he collapse
Young Money we the crap, no salary cap
Money talks bitch and mines yap, yap, yap
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
If you a bad bitch, say fuck them other hoes
I’m feelin' real good, Stevie Wonder-ful
And we don’t talk about it, we do it, do it, nigga
Shit can get ugly, Patrick Ewing, nigga
Them niggas can’t see me, but I see through them niggas
And fuck the police, on or off duty nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I’m on some other shit, I’m stuntin' on them hoes
Bitch I’m smokin' pot, like I’m on the stove
I’m in this bitch, bitch, I’m so Hollygrove
Them hoes treasure me, like a pot of gold
Boy, you thin crust, fuckin' Dominoes
I’m laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
We do it real big, astronomical
I make her fall for me, bitch, Geronimo
Now get it poppin for a nigga, show me what you’re workin' with
I’m fly as a mothafucker bitch, no turbulence
Please know my niggas got them pistols for emergencies
I’m lookin' for a head doctor for some brain surgery
Some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I’m bout to kill these hoes
I’m laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
I make her fall for me, bitch, Geronimo
50 shots in a chopper, break em off proper
You niggas can’t see me, fuck yo binoculars
I’ma coconut Ciroc’er, a beast like Chewbacca
I’m runnin' this shit, I don’t even need blockers

[Birdman]
Priceless, fresh off an island, hundred mill
Bitch we the bidness, 5-star gangsta, moola, crazy

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Carter IV, it's on
Yeah, it sound like that Lil', man, they be like "Wayne
That nigga right over there, that nigga's from another planet"
Cut the weed, pop-pop
Insanity shit, niggas from this planet can't see
U-u-u-u-uhh

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Leavin' nothin' but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cookin' and I'm a server
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
He's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
Really be bussin' up, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drug and touchin' every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Ballin' nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo bidness

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin’ at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
AA whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, out

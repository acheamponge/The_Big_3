[Intro: Lydia Pense & Lil Wayne]
You leave your home for days and days
Yeah (Hey)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Lydia Pense]
Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither (But hey)
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers (But hey)
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers (But hey)
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño (Hey)
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket (But hey)
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip (But hey)
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter (But hey)
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tapeworm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big-headed, my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi (Hey)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz & Lydia Pense]
(But hey) Yeah, 2 Chainz (But hey)
I might book me for a show (But hey)
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough (But hey)
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures (But hey)
I like math, all I did was add bitches (Hey)
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours (But hey)
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle (Hey)
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in (Hey)
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me (With me)
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it (Damn)
Everything authentic (Tru), plus I named my pistols
Last name "Fuck," first name "I Don't Give A" (Bah)
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure, yeah

[Refrain: Lydia Pense & Lil Wayne]
You leave your home for days and days
Alright, uh (Hey)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Lydia Pense]
All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks (But he—)
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink (Hey)
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat (But hey)
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat (But hey)
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious (But—)
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss, I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you
Tunechi

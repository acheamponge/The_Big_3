[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
I be with niggas that shoot police
I keep that iron, you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck, bitch ya lying through ya teeth
They say it cost to be the boss, the ones in jail wish they were free
Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues, well I'm checkin' your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas
I'm a Blood, is you a blood donor? Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways, caddy-corner
Then she catch that nut like pneumonia, Lil Tunechi

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Lay it down ho, lay it down bitch
Lay it down ho, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Put the money on the couch nigga
Gimme everything up in yo house nigga, shut yo mouth nigga
Put the money on the couch nigga
Gimme everything up in yo house nigga, shut yo mouth nigga

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Start it up, vroom vroom
Uppercut a bitch out the bus, boom boom
Unless I get the brain, poom poom
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train, zoom zoom
Tryna get paid too soon, one deep, one sweep away in a room room
We getting money over here, talking shit and fucking bitches
I don't know what the fuck they doing Tune
My syrup purple, my turf Earth, my birth circle, I'll dirt surf you
I'll squirt murk you, my verse hurtful
My shooters still got curb curfews
Y'all bout as hot as Von Dutch, y'all not gone harm much
Hijack y'all some prom busts; ain't no retreat but my arms up
No graffiti, my bombs up, it's Young Money in this shit
Until a nigga dead and gone
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on?
I'm betting the wedding's off when everything is wetted on
Point 'em out, Truk ya life, fuck ya style, fuck with me
You a bucket foul, niggas'll buck ya smile for a dunkin pile
You better duck it, pal

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Lay it down ho, lay it down bitch
Lay it down ho, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down...

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo
Shawty, what's yo, name? Is you trickin'? Is you payin'?
Is you sniffin' on that caine? What the fuck, is you saying?
If you getting it, then you getting it, it's my money I ain't splitting it
I ain't tripping it, if she got a fat ass, then I'm tipping it
Came out the bank, bye teller, give a bum money, hi fella
Bad lil' ho, high yellow, Brand new Rolie, Sky Dweller
Just left from Dubai, flew private eye
I made a million dollars, swear to God that ain't no lie
I said, them niggas was poppin', fake niggas be watchin
My black glove be drippin wet, but I got my Cochran
Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine
The Maybach ain't poppin, if it ain't got no partation
Oops, I mean partition,it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money, while I watch you bitches audition
I said oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition, hehehe

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Fuck wrong with you bitches?
I don’t give a fuck; you don’t hear me, you don’t see me
Bitch you gon' feel me ho
Young Money, Young, Young Money nigga
Young, Young, lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down

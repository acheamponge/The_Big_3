[Intro/Outro]
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut
And that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
We fuck and crash that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
Ok

[Verse 1]
Fuck my hand, suck my thumb
Be a lady and buy me lunch
Send me cards, make me read
But don't send me no flowers unless it's weed
Cause I'm that nigga, she say Im that nigga
She ain't got a man but act like I'm that nigga
She check my phone, what's that 'bout?
Any other ho I would've cursed her ass out
But that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
She kiss my ankle when I twisted my ankle
She even did anal when she don't do anal
My bitch, I'm thankful, let's hold hands (Can we?)
Let's slow dance (shall we?)
And we gon be like 1, 2, 1, 2
She said Im the one, girl you the one too
I stand up in that pussy like a sunroof
Yeah

[Hook]
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut

[Verse 2]
Ok, now give me coochie at my mama's crib
On Thanksgiving everybody's listening
All your home girl's bad and they're our guest
Let'em all in and I'll play chef
That's romance cause we so real
She said she cannot take the pain, if it ain't a pill
She said fuck these hoes, they just mad
We fucked a ho together, that's romance
If you got cups then I got dranks
I take my rubber off and put that money in the bank
I ain't your friend, fuck that shit
Tryna find another me girl good luck with that shit

[Hook]
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance

[Intro]
Pump that bass

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick, semi automatic, no click click
We don't feel you, like an elephant getting fucked with a tick dick
Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch
I gotta put that patch over my third eye: Slick Rick
Trukfit, T-shirt, talk second, skeet first
Boy, your girl a jump off, I hope she land feet first
She give me brain: research, and I prefer reefer
But if you want some coke, that's cool, 'cause my homies still

[Hook: Lil Wayne, Big Sean, & Both]
Yeah, my homies still
Haha, my homies still
Yeah, my homies still
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah (boy)
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, (go dumb) go stupid, yeah
(Whoa, boy)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, my girls and cars both skrt off (skrt)
I like a pussy so wet that I can surf off (whoa)
In a hotspot 'cause a nigga never chillin' (chillin')
I do it for my niggas, I just do it to these bitches
Boy, I overgrind (whoa), overshine (whoa)
Ain't another nigga over Sean (boy, boy)
I'm getting paid, it's Oprah time (boy, boy)
I’m rollin' pine, I’m so divine
I’m west side, west side, dark glasses on like I'm goin' blind
Looking like Eazy E, it’s just me and Lil Weezy-we
Get off my dick!

[Hook: Lil Wayne, Big Sean, & Both]
Yeah, my homies still (whoa)
Haha, my homies still (boy, boy, boy)
Yeah, my homies still (whoah, oh God)
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid (boy, boy), yeah
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah
(Whoa, whoa, oh God)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Big Sean]
Look, I’m east side, them haters 90 going west (boy, boy, boy)
My niggas pumping so much bass, motherfuckers going deaf (huh?)
Weezy F, I'm east side, them haters 90 going west
My niggas pumping so much bass (pump that bass)
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, I don’t love them hoes
Got so much coke, you gon' need another nose
Man, I just play my hand, but I am not the dealer
You see I got them tear drops, I cry your ass a river
I got that Trukfit T-shirt, listening to Rebirth
I skate until my feet hurt, Hot Boy, free Turk
Pussy for dessert, put your ass beneath Earth
And I don’t sell drugs, but if you need work
My homies still

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Big Sean]
Yeah, my homies still
Haha, my homies still
Yeah, my homies still
Whoa, okay

[Verse 4: Big Sean & Lil Wayne]
Boy, this here’s what I do do (do do)
Got your sister dancing, not the kind that's in a tutu (no)
Got me in control, no strings attached, that's that voodoo (go)
She said can’t nobody do it better, I tell her, "True, true," yeah, bitch, true, true
My, my, my bro-bro say these bitches ain't shit (ain't shit)
I got the girl you came with and the girl she came with
She leaking and drippin’, whoa, there I might just come slip in (whoa, whoa, whoa)
And your misses gonna go missin’ if she addicted to what my dick did
Boy, I get it! (I get it)
Lil bitch!

[Hook: Lil Wayne, Big Sean & Both]
My homies still
Haha, my homies still (Finally Famous in this)
Yeah my homies still (G.O.O.D.)
Little nigga make my goons go stupid
Go stupid (go stupid), go stupid (go stupid) (boy, boy)
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, yeah (go dumb)

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Big Sean]
Look, I’m eastside them haters 90 going West (whoa)

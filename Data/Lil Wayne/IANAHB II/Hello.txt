[Intro: Lil Wayne & Shane Heyl]
Cut the fuckin’ music up
YMCMB, GTWYC
Yeah
It’s about that time! How about you man?
Uh, yeah
Goat Mouf Gumbo

Brain stretched out
Yeah, bitch
Shake Junt, Shake Junt
Yeah, Chicken bone Nowison
Nowison
Death wish, bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, California house in the hills, big windows, no blinds
Can't sleep past 9, we pass weed like time over here
Money over fear, her lipstick smeared, her pussy lip pierced
Daddy gotta go after Daddy get his, see ya later alligator
Crying crocodile tears, don't worry I'll be back
If her pussy like crack, she got a nice rack and that apple bottom
Bite that Apple like Mac, that's that computer love
I kill that pussy but I don't go to the funeral
Cause I'mma wear this ass out like a uniform
So ride this dick like a horse, pony, unicorn
Phone in her back pocket made the EHHHH
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & (Shayne Heyl)]
I said hello, hello, she said "oh shit!"
I ain't mean to call you, anyway, what you doing
I said nothing, she said I know what you should be doing
And could be doing, open up your legs, walk me through it
Ain't too proud to beg, psh nigga please, I fell on my head
And she fell on her knees, what you know about that (Uhh)
I be on my head and she be on her knees
What you know about that? Bitch, bitch! Ugh!
Skate, smoke, fuck, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, California house in the hills, big windows, no blinds
Can't sleep past 9, we pass weed like time over here
Money over fear, her lipstick smeared, her pussy lip pierced
Daddy gotta go after Daddy get his, see ya later alligator
Crying crocodile tears, don't worry I'll be back
If her pussy like crack, she got a nice rack and that apple bottom
Bite that Apple like Mac, that's that computer love
I kill that pussy but I don't go to the funeral
Cause I'mma wear this ass out like a uniform
So ride this dick like a horse, pony, unicorn
Phone in her back pocket made the EHHHH
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & (Shayne Heyl)]
I said hello, hello, she said "oh shit!"
I ain't mean to call you, anyway, what you doing
I said nothing, she said I know what you should be doing

Ain't too proud to beg, psh nigga please, I fell on my head
And she fell on her knees, what you know about that (Uhh)
I be on my head and she be on her knees
What you know about that? Bitch, bitch! Ugh!
Skate, smoke, fuck, yeah

[Verse 3: Shane Heyl]
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Goat Mouf Gumbo's Here to save ya
"S" on my chest, like a Super-Man vest
Shake Junt!, I'mma say it again, Shake Junt!
Buck up my friends
Wondering, dreaming, constantly thinking
Tik-tok, Skello, Tik-tok Skello! Time's wasting
Had a chance, now look at the mess
Evil thoughts they run in my head
Get there, while you can, I say get there while you can
No you can't, yes I can
Pushin' fast at 50 milli got me screamin' faster!
Green and yellow do it again
Let it go, Back it up, boom! Boom! Titties & Milk!
Squirt, Squirt, till it don't, miss miss
Don't forget, miss miss, don't forget miss miss
Don't forget, miss miss, Don't forget Chicken bone Nowison
Don't forget Chicken bone Nowison
Don't forget Chicken bone Nowison
Is anybody out there!?

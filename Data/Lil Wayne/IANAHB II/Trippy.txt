[Intro: Juicy J]
We trippy man

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, blue skies, blue skies
I see you with my red eyes
Bust your fucking grape, nigga
Turn your shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high, nigga
I'm too gone, bye nigga
She get dick, weed, and ignored
Thats a D.W.I., nigga
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin'
The pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seeing shit
I'm blowing like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong
Got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fucking Mary-Jane
I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger
I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back
And keep blinking like hazards
I said king me, king me
With my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs
My cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse
What I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard
Bitch, look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth
I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again
OK, I'm reloaded

[Hook: Juicy J]
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shoutout to my weed man
Shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something
I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga, don't blow it
I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm coming or going
T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashing, life passing
Take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses
Shot glasses
Hot flashes
My tongue's numb, I can't talk
No balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks
I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell
High as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies
I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit
I hope I trip and fall in some pussy
Tunechi

[Hook: Juicy J]

That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Musty herb in a Ziploc
Twistin' up top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes, nigga

[Hook: Juicy J]

That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea
Weed, pills, and that drank
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea

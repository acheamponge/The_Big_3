[Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, e'rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be diggin' me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up shit’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B’s up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

[Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there, redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there, we ain't got no worries

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you tryna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe, that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch, it's Tunechi and I'm out chea, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit be a long story
YEAHHH, OHH SHIT, I'M UP, YEAHH, YOUNG MULA BABY!

[Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there

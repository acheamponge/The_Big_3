[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Mike WiLL Made-It)
I got some down bitches I can call (What's happenin'?)
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall (I'ma ball, ball, ball)

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me (Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I can give a fuck 'bout no nigga
Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I lost a few good bitches, met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas, pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hatin', I'm getting ass, or I'm skatin'
I lost a few good bitches, met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas, pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hatin', I'm getting ass, or I'm skatin'

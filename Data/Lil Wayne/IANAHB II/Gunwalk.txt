[Hook: Lil Wayne]
(Yeah ho!) I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
(Yeah ho!) See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
(Yeah ho!) I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
(Yeah ho!) Yeah, I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
(Yeah ho!) See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
(Yeah ho!) I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
(Yeah ho!) And there's no talking back when my gun talk

[Post-Hook: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
Yeah, see me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, fuck that nigga, ho-ass nigga
Leave that nigga with a toe tag, nigga
Barrel so long you can pole dance, nigga
Run up in ya house, where the dope at, nigga?
Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I walk around with this shotgun
And this bitch bigger than me, nigga
Don't open up your fuckin' mouth
'Cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth, nigga
Shoot 'em up then leave, nigga, I smell Summer's Eve, nigga
We shoot first, it's better to give than receive, nigga

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
Yeah, I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And there's no talkin' back, when my gun talk

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Keep that ho shit over there (Yeah ho!)
And we don't shoot in the air
I can't fuck with these niggas, man, these niggas gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that motherfucker's hair
It's like, man, you can't trust nobody
I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga, 'cause I duck hunt
Bitch, rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this motherfucker
That's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room, rushed over
Hollow tips, in the clip
My gun loaded, yours sober
I pull your card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got your gun drawn
I'll send you back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi

[Post-Hook: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
You don't talk back, when I cock back
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
Yeah!

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Walking 'round this motherfucker limpin'
'Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, throw your body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and embodyin' the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much, do drive-by's and walk-up's
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star-struck
I don't fuck with lame niggas, I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nickname is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga; Eastside, I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right, or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda

[Bridge: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And it's no talkin' back when it go off
You speechless, you speechless
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
You speechless, you speechless
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
You speechless, you speechless
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
You speechless, you speechless - when I cock back

[Post-Hook: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk

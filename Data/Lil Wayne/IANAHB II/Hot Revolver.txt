[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She's askin' "do you have the time
To listen to me whine?"
She's askin', "who's on the other line?"
You diss me everytime
I tell her, baby I'm a star, shit, I'm above the stars
And now, I done got so high, I done forgotten who you are

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I tell her
I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
Cause I just come to take it
Then you know I gotta take off
But I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Cause she say "Wayne you ain't shit
You got me all impatient"
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

[Hook: Dre]
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And soon she's gonna find someone to love
And you gon find yourself, so all alone

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
One minute she love me, the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she pray she have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures, but she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways...
And you have your days...
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed
I'm sorry

[Hook]

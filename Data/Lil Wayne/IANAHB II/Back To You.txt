[Hook]
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you

[Verse 1]
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoeing, but she the only one worth knowing
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, "Okay I'm your honor"
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass I just be like, "Come sit your groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine, Tunechi!

Now, I know the only compass that I need
I'm putting my hat back on
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you

[Verse 2]
I got that shit in my system
Somebody gonna be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it?
'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right
That early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight, one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

[Hook: Jamie Lidell sample]
"Now, I know the only compass that I need"
I'm putting my glasses back on
"Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you"

[Bridge]
Should I call somebody else?
'Cause, girl, it's almost twelve and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, eh, eh
Should I call somebody else?
Cuz girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

[Hook: Jamie Lidell sample]
"Now, I know the only compass that I need"
I'm putting you back on
"Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you"

[Outro]
You need to get to me baby
But you already got to me

This is what they call me

[Verse 1]
Eagle, Eagle Carter man
In a '96 Regal contraband
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Got to wash that money and get on my ass
Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast
I got to do something I done blown my last
Dollar holler at your boy on the ave
In that Jeep pidico is what I'm known to have
Shit tend to be slow I put on the mask
And make it Halloween and take all your bags
I say Holly-holly grove won't you go and stand up
And make these motherfuckers understand
I say: "Look coach they pitching at me under hand"
But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya'll men designing women, I'm a woman's man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band, and
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'm a major set back when my album drop
I got that wet crack flow out ya mami's pot
I got that jet black four at ya mami's spot
I'm trying to get back door I demand it now
Yeah, panic now, you better pan it down
'Fore the neighbors they overhear me tear it down
Yeah it's Weezy F. Baby and his crown, the prince

[Hook - Reel]
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

[Verse 2]
And the hand gun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya ho I don't want your contusions
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It's money over bitches that I am going to keep proving
It's Weezy F, I got ya momma groovin'
Out of all the Hot Boyz she say I'm the coolest
I bought my bag of oranges its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm trying to seduce it
I floss, a awful lot of haters try and reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyeing you stupid
One shot to remind you who is
That fly little nigga that's behind the trigger, Wizzle
I'm off chronic combined with liquor
But niggas'll never see me like Momma Tigger
A 80's-baby a fighting nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I'm something you call pepper like a Viking slick
See me over the viking stove I'm whitening bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out untightening clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting a spliff
I do this you catching my drift
Representing with my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So roll the carpet out cause you fucking with a nigga from the royal South
See you either in or you out and if you out stay in cause them warriors out
Those vultures, them cops, and the lawyers out
I just open up the gate and let my hoyas out
No nigga I never call your house I'm probably somewhere taking Toya out
Not answering my phone, man, ignoring ya spouse
She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name naw better yet point him out
Hey, me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talking sweet I get them cavities out
I got graveyard fliers man I'm passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now I am the prince

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah shawty you know what I'm talkin' about
I'm peepin' these niggas out there slippin', lookin' like
They ain't 'bout money no mo' man, so uh fuck
You know what we gon' do huh, what we been doin' ha nigga
We gon' load up get a lot mo get a lot mo and say fuck em nigga
Keep buyin' shit, keep fuckin' hoes
Loadin' up on mo' bitches
Then you know what I'm sayin', we gon' get greedy too nigga
I ain't never gettin' full
I'm full blooded with this grind
Yeah they don't understand lil nigga

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Murder capital only key to survive is kill
If the elements don't murder you the riders will for real
And niggas know I go hard to the fullest
Get involved and I got em playing dodgeball with bullets
Yeah, I got the sawed-off fully
In the Sean John hoodie, get fucked, you play pussy
Ha, we hit 'em up while they lookin'
And them body shots hurt, but the head shots took him
Damn, and if the red dot spot 'em then the hollow head got 'em
Knock his top to his bottom jack
Yeah, you see we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom at the very bottom of the map
Lil Weezyana piranhas everywhere you at
You gotta wear ya extra condom and a extra gat
Your bitch can get it for actin' like a man
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like your man
I backwards hand your man on command
In front of niggas he cool with them boys on fan
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates
Ducking the animal keeper runnin' with my primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in five states
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in the drought I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest pa' sub par
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive 'em for they know not who they pushin' Lord
Father forgive me if I have to send em to you Lord
I'm just tryin' dodge the shots they send to the God
They ridin' up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive
Not even in a eye exam, they ain't lookin' for I
The A and the K will make your face crook to the side
Now when you smilin' everybody gotta look from the side
Cause when you wildin' you ain't lookin' you just lookin' high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato-ass nigga, you lemon merengue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me get the biscuit busta
What up, Gizzle? You my distant brother
Real shit, nigga, same father, different mother
I skip the frontin' and stick to keepin' it trill
You not know me for nothin' other I'm somethin' other
Than people you feel I'm deeper for real I'm deeper than skills
My speeches can kill, rest in peace

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah, you underdig, shawty? It's all about one thing nigga
If you bout money, nigga, come fuck with us
If you ain't bout no money, get the fuck from 'round us, nigga
And whatever you bout, we bout it
However you wanna get, we can give it to ya, nigga
All runners, bitch, you underdig? Put your prints in, nigga
Put your feet down and your nuts on the concrete and let's roll

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You sleep in the field for trying the dude
I'll bust ya head to the meat turn ya mind to food
Food for thought, think I ain't lyin' to you
I lie his body in grease, set fire to em
I tie his body in sheets put the tires to em
Make em feel the Escalade put his feet in the blades
Damn! I'm the heat in the blaze
And niggas keep they ways when I'm in the streets wit blay What!
My nigga hungry he'll eat the plate
And if I ask the homeboy'll eat ya face, yea!
And though he got me, you can ask I'm like a pool table
I keep the eight, my side pocket side ways
When I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days
Birdman talk to em

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah nigga, I tell em, I'll tell em again shawty
If it ain't bout no money, get and fall the fuck from 'round me nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Check my swag, I travel like sound dawg
You play hard and Iâ€™m gravel like ground dawg
I'm underground, call me groundhog
Lay down laws, call the ground law
Don't confuse me wit' the law, naw
But just confuse me with my pa because I am the Birdman J.R
I ain't trippin' nigga, I play the corner like Ripken nigga
With the forty Cal Ripken nigga, rip a nigga
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack ya baby momma but I'll let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still
Cause the lil nigga still ride on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
The Sig peel bandanas like bananas
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana
In my Cabana wit my bottom bitch from Savannah
Man a train couldn't stop ya man
I man up and you not a man, I stand up say I got my land
I'm the man of my land call it Lil-Weezy-ana
That's the new plan

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah nigga, you bout some money get at me nigga
That's the only way
Dumb shit we bout that get at me you undadig
Nigga roll solo, dolo nigga

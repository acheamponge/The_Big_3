[Chorus: Jazze Pha & Lil Wayne]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, speak to 'em Jazze)
I (Yeah, fly guy)
I'm way more fly than you (That's right)
I'll take your dime from you (That's right)
Now she wanna spend (What?)
All night with me (She wanna wake up with Weezy F. Baby)
Let me be the one that you throw it to
(Throw it back ma
Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)
Baby, I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
(Yea so how 'bout you huh?
Yeah, yeah, so how 'bout you?)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'll take your bitch, give her back, take your bitch again
That's because you throw a 5, I pitch a 10
Now she wanna get inside of me 66
She see my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man, she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick, me
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip, yup
And I don't lie I confess
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though
Gotta stay clean, plus mami in a Lex 4
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death
It's the Birdman Jr., sincerely yours
When it rains it pours, when it Waynes it whores

(Chorus)
[Chorus: Jazze Pha & Lil Wayne]
I (Yeah, yeah)
I'm way more fly than you (That's right)
I'll take your dime from you (That's right)
Now she wanna spend all night with me
(She wanna wake up with Weezy F. Baby)
Let me be the one that you throw it to
(Throw it back ma
Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)
Baby, I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
(So how 'bout you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so how 'bout you?)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ay, now why you wanna go and do that?
I can see through that
Tattoo right there like I can't view that
Girl, what that say? Wait, who that?
Bet he was lame, bet he ain't Lil Wayne, no
Cause I'm way more fly, yeah
Have you hangin' 'round a bunch of yayo buyers, nope
And not a day go by us
We don't get higher than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone off, we ridin'
Where phones don't roam, they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleeping in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds we can stare at the morning, yeah
But I can't be there all morning
I'm a pimp baby, yeah I'm going, going, going, gone

[Chorus: Jazze Pha & Lil Wayne]
I (Yeah)
I'm way more fly than you (That's right)
I'll take your dime from you (That's right)
Now she wanna spend all night with me
(She wanna wake up to Weezy F. Baby)
Let me be the one that you throw it to
(Throw it back ma
Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)
Baby, I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
(So how 'bout you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so how 'bout you?)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, uh, I'm sorry, I was grooving
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music
But let's get back to what we was doing
Laid back in that 'Lac on Pat Ewing's
That's 33 [?] tires, he fire
These trees ain't papaya, mind ya
Gotta keep heat on your side, [?]
So I'm a get 3 more and cop you one
Wait, naw hun, cause you ain't exempt
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip, yeah
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip
And you walk kinda mean, how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script, yeah
I said I stick to my grip
I stick to my money, that's life to me
Sorry honey Jazze

[Chorus: Jazze Pha & Lil Wayne]
I (Yeah)
I'm way more fly than you (That's right)
I'll take your dime from you (That's right)
Now she wanna spend all night with me
(She wanna wake up to Weezy F. Baby)
Let me be the one that you throw it to
(Throw it back ma
Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)
Baby, I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
(So how 'bout you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so how 'bout you?)

So how 'bout you, yeah
So how 'bout you
See what I'm talking 'bout sweet heart?
You ain't even gotta have John Madden
You ain't gotta have Dick Vitale
You ain't gotta Lee Corso
You ain't gotta have Stuart Scott
You ain't gotta have Linda Cohn
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
You ain't gotta have the staff of ESPN
You ain't gotta have ABC staff just to speak sports, baby
Cause I got game, sweetheart
Just fuck with your boy and I'll get you a jersey
What you want me to put on the back?
"Daddy's little girl", that's right
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
I can't give you the game, but I can show the game
And you can see what you see and peek how you peek
And get what you get
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Weezy

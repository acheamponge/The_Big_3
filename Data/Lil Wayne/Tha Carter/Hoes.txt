[Intro: Lil Wayne & Mannie Fresh]
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, hoes
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, hoes
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You gotta talk like a pimp
What's good mama, you knew better
You'd do better, who better
Than that nigga with the crisp white tee
Icy white sneaks, jeans to a fitta
You do better gettin yo ass off up in that coupe bitch
Sit yo ass on that new leather and regroup bitch
It's only me you bitch, on our way to tha stoop
I'm the Birdman Jr., you ain't know
And don't gimme that silly bullshit about you ain't, ho
I move you to my city, put yo ass in UNO
I have you looking pretty hit the ave. now get tha dough
That Gucci gon fit cha like you posed to be in pictures
I got computer love baby Wayne a change ya image
You need Weezy, them other boys just gimmicks
Me, I'm just game, green, and straight physics, Is ya wit it?
Yea, I ain't even tryin ta hit it
I'mma get it when it's time ta get it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
Motherfuck 'em

[Break: Lil Wayne]
Ladies and gentlemen, the great Manuella

[Verse 2: Mannie Fresh]
I got this rat named Shelly that love Makavelli
Number five combo meals and splashin' KY jelly
I have old school shorty, still drink a forty
Grab the mic, start a fight, and fuck up the whole party
Baby you should leave, adjust yo weave
That's velcro, hell no, bitch go wit Steve
I got this lead singer bitch from a popular group
I would say her name, but she bought me a coupe
Got this super ho Shawna, smell like marijuana
How she dig Lil Wayne, but she love the Big Tymers
Got pretty girl Patrice found out I'm fuckin her niece
She tried to stab me, so I grabbed her and we called the police
Mister Officer, the bitch done lost it bruh
She goin to jail, oh well, I be fuckin her
See two dyke Spanish twins nuts pressed on they chin
Will we go video, well nigga, that depends

[Chorus; Lil Wayne]
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
Motherfuck 'em

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got old school bitches and new school hoes
Female basketball players with cornrolls
And I don't like short-haired girls, no not really
If I do, she gotta look like the old Halle Berry
Or the broke Toni Braxton, the first Lil Kim
But I still take hood rats and work with them
Put yo ass in a jag and I drop ya quick
Give ya ass a lil game, if ya smirk ya in
I'm a pimp, not a simp, like ice in my drink
And I don't think twice or blink cause I'm focused
Rollin in the whitest mink like I'm polar
Bear, yea, let down my hair
Get jazzy on a bitch like Fred Astaire
Rose gold in her face get her red as glare
My Bentley plum, my Mercedes pear
I am lookin for a freak, mama take me there, yea

[Chorus; Lil Wayne]
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
Motherfuck 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
Motherfuck 'em

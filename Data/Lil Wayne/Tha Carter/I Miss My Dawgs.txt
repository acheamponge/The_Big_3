[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the Carter muthafucka, yea
And in my building I must keep it real

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And man I miss the times
We would shine, you would keep on your side
You would teach me how to ride
And you would teach me how to pride
Then we get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position
And that's when you changed position, shit
I never changed and I miss ya, and it's strange
But I never forget ya
Though that ain't you with them bitches homie
And I know that ain't you wit that dissin on me, that's why I
Never replied and never will, just let em live phony
If ya ever died, I swear to God, I got yo kids homie
What's mine is theirs, I gotta give homie, and yea
We still a army in this bitch homie
Yeah Cash Money still the shit homie, shit, homie!
What's really real is you feelin me nigga
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word to giggity nigga
And I ain't got time to speak the history
I miss you and I know you missin me, Gizzle, but

[Hook: Reel]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
[Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I remember when you came to the clique
I had already made my name in the clique
But you got famous and shit
I got my soulja rag and dangled my shit
I was honored just to hang wit you, shit
And I banged to the boogie-bang-bang with ya clique
And I ain't even from the 3, my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post with the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin for a nigga to jump, see I was patient
But was ready to dump, cuz you my brother, chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back
Or turn ya down, even if you turned around, muthafucka
But history is history
I miss you and I know you missin me, Juvie, but

[Hook: Reel]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You was my nigga, my nerve, my joy, my hurt
My main muthafuckin man Turk (oh!)
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you LEFT!
Remember how we played to the left?
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
'Member B and Slim would leave and the keys over?
Tell us not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo souljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the Stunna
Yeah, those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I eye my brother
Yeah, nigga, Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The niggas you left behind is my brothers!

[Hook: Reel]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again

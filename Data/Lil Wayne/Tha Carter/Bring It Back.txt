[Intro: Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen, people with jobs, people without jobs
Middle class, upper class, high class, all that
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks, elderly people, and twerkers
I presents to you
Fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fre, fre, fresh
DJ Mannie Fresh, fresh, fre, fresh
Mannie Fresh, fre, fresh
DJ Mannie Fre, fre, fresh, young ladies

[Hook x2: Mannie Fresh]
Put ya hands on ya knees and bend ya rump
Put ya back in, back out, do the hump

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Well, I'm fly as a son of gun, son of a stunna
Yeah, high as a 757 going to heaven
Who, Weezy F, ya reverend, preach about me
I'm the god, 1-7, Apple and E
I'm the Cash Money Makaveli, y'all ain't ready
Quick, fast like Tom Petty, y'all just petty
'82, I was born ready, I'm too ready
Y'all Betty Crocker baller blockers, I'm too heavy
Meatball, Lamborghini, top spaghetti
Seats ragout, twenty the shoe
Boo, me and you got plenty to do
I don't need no pool, I'm swimming in you
And I sleep with the sharks, shawty, on that water water
In the Beamer, eight hundred forty, mama, shake something for me
And it don't make sense if it don't make that money
I'mma take that money, I'm straight Cash Money

[Hook x2: Mannie Fresh]

[Post-Hook x3: Lil Wayne]
Whodi, I bring it back, whodettes, to the bottom of the maps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I take off my brim
Moment of silence for the homeboy Soulja Slim
Fronting 'round here will get ya back chopped off
We do our own thing, we don't act like y'all
I say, black white walls with the back swiped off
Y'all lil bustas just a tax write-off
I'm a stand up guy, not the type that fall
We don't breed them kind, but they bleed just fine
Weezy the Don, homie, read between the lines
If ya can't, boy, read my nine
I'm going hard in the paint like Diesel time
Either I'm the illest cat doing it or these cats is losing it
I be easy, fall back and be cool with it
Pallbearer is moving his dead flow, I'm through with it
I'm the sh--naw, naw, I'm sewer-rich
Weezy F Baby, I do's this

[Hook x2: Mannie Fresh]

[Post-Hook x3: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
An old school gangsta, mack like the 80s
I look like Cita and act like Baby
You play with me, I react like the navy
Or better yet the army, you gon' need them for me
Yeah, and your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeping Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep in New Orleans
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples
Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividend's not little
Don't be surprised how the crown fit him
Uh, get down, uh, get down for the young Pac footprints

[Outro x2: Lil Wayne]
The best rapper alive since the best rapper retired

[Verse]
And in here is where the heroin boil
And I also got a large pot of cigarette oil
That's Embalming fluid, illiterate are you
That's ok man I got the medicine for you
I got, I got, I got the amphetamine for you
Got that vitamin D-R-U-G for your shorty
One window to let the dawn in
Cuz we hustle in this bitch midnight to morning, yea
We dump in and pump out
I showed you this window for you to jump out
You on the backyard lawn where a nigga got the ganja growin'
No cats or dogs, rats or snakes, Sams or Jakes
Around here it's all gravy, ham and steak
Mama cookin' that up, here have a plate
That's: Mama Carter she's a basket case
But I make sure her sandwich and napkins straight
You pick wit this picnic and I'm at your face, Fucka!
I say I'm at your throat, this was *Tha Carter*, slam the door, GO!

[Verse 1]
Ain't no snitches ridin wit us
Ol mo the mouth niggas could holla the front
Can't no loose slips get on my yacht
I leave player haters at the dock, watch
And your nigga help ya burn the block
As soon as you get hot nigga turn to cop
Ya settin up federal appointments now
Nigga all in court pointing out
Daddy not knowing what he doin his child
We gon mail him his finger when he get out, yea
Just to show him what we's about
Never let shit about G'z leave ya mouth, yea
You inside can't leave ya house
Two donut lovers to police ya house
I sneak past those brothers leak in ya house
And put the heat dead in yo mouth, so shut up

[Outro]
Yea nigga watch the people around you watch the people away from you
Leave them niggas be let them stay from you
These niggas mouth's is runnin like hot water, I swear to God
Real niggas takin falls like Niagara
Tryna stay up like Viagra, but it ain't gon happen
These niggas is best buddies wit the 5-0 team they know the DA by name
It ain't a game - it used to be one
Its like these niggas got them big ducks in they mouth that the gynecologist
Use when yo bitch get a pap smear
That's pussy anyway
Weezy

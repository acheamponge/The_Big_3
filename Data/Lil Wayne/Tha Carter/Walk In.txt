[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
It's the Carter motherfucker, I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker, I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker
Let me show you my building man, it's the Carter
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs, the ups the down, know what I'm talking 'bout
This is me, fourth solo album baby, I came back around
By myself this time, back off the wall
Guns up in the air in the middle of the street like bang, bang, bang bang, welcome

[Verse]
Welcome, this is the Carter y'all welcome
Hard as Malcolm, dark as The Falcon, Lord help him
But y'all felt him, and that make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughta be
Doing, recording me, I'm just acting accordingly, I give orders
To the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me, I just hand 'em to P
Any drama, I pace it like Indiana
I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one starting to heat up
Got Mannie hot with me cuz I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up starting to look like V'd up
I'm G'd up on the re-up up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin about no speakers
What's leaking up out of your speakers is the speech of Weezy F. Baby
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on, (let's go)
Front door, living room young nigga switching weed
What you need? Get you crack, get you weed
Make your way to the back, look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom giving head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Then he tried to ruin it, but I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that, let's keep it movin'
Onto the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin'
Uh huh, look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked, look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from Promethazine to Metamucil
I'm crucial, don't mean to spook you
But, this is New Orleans, so my queens do voodoo, ya know?
So the things just move through
I feel your pain, I got things to soothe you
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution, fucker

[Outro]
I came back around, it's the Carter
Show you the rest of the house later
We gonna go upstairs, ya know
You know what this is right
The Carter, the Carter, the Carter

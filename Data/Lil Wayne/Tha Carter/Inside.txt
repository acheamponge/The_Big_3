[Intro]
I came back around, I came back around, I came back around
Tha Carter, motherfucker
It's Tha Carter, man
Right now we still in the kitchen, man
You checking out them bitches' booties, right? I know
Yeah, but let's move on, man, I got plenty more house to show you, man
Plenty more Carter to give you
You know? Let's go, man

[Verse]
Now let me show you upstairs
Got the glass house floor to let me know who up there
Look down and you see your reflection
You ain't gotta know who down here
You just know you protected
Ay mane, how I don't know you connected?
Here's a little morphine, let me see you inject it
That's right, little wodie respect this
Understand me or get cha mammy a deathwish
Part I, Part II, Part III
All the parts of Godfather, all a part of me
If you look to the wall you see
A few gagged up, tied up, scared pricks
Got 'em facing the wall like they was on Blair Witch
I ain't Jason at all but it get scary 'bout my chips (yeah)
And in here is where I keep the bricks
Acknowledge Lil Marley in the hallway
He got the clips
Don't shoot 'em, Marley

[Outro]
Yeah, that's my little dude Marley, man
He hold me down, you know what I'm talking about?
I'll show you the rest of the house later, man
You wait right here, I'll be back
Carter, Carter, Carter

Dwayne, mama proud of you
You done came so far
I can't wait for your album to come out
A lot of people ask me when it's coming out
They can't wait for your album to come out
I'm just proud of you
You's my rock, you've always been my rock
Mama love you, I love you
You take care of me and then some
And your brother, we donâ€™t wanted for nothing
I thank the Lord every day for keeping us on this earth
And in good health
I just pray things go well with you in life
But I thank the Lord, because I know you have been through a lot that I don't even know about
Mama love you
I love you Dwayne, with all my heart
You is my life
I live for you
You make sure mama's tooken care of
I don't care if you don't have it, you gon' make sure I get it anyway
Even though you don't have it to give
And my son though, Semaj, ain't wanted for nothing
Anything Semaj call you for, you gon' make sure he get it
Your children ain't wanted for nothin', you is a man, a truly man
Mama love you, I can't wait 'til your album come out
Because everybody asking about it and I know it's gon' be a beautiful album
Love you, Dwayne

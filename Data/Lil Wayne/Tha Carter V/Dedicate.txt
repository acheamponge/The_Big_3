[Intro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be
You tatted your face
Bugatti, new boo
You screamed, "Suu whoop"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
And see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans
Than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can
To keep it solid as a you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, "Suu whoop," and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, you just part of this shit
I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp
And your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money
Like, "Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?"
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit
For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet tangy
I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch
If I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit
Walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit
In the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, "Suu whoop," and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit
I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit
Put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit
'Bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just tha Carter lil' bitch

[Outro: Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz & Barack Obama]
You changed, suu whoop (You tatted your face)
Bugatti, new boo (You screamed, "Suu whoop")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi
(If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be)
They might think they've got a pretty good jump shot, or a pretty good flow. But our kids can't all aspire to be LeBron or Lil Wayne!

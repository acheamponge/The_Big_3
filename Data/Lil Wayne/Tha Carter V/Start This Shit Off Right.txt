[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I fucked around and made a buncha fuck around money
Now I feel like found money
I'm fuckin' awesome, 'til awesome have a child for me
Got homies who ain't comin' home 'til the cows comin'
Niggas with power, they tryna press our power buttons
Now baby make that ass clap like it's proud of me
She said, "I will," like ill with an apostrophe
Its Lil Tunechi, word around on the streets
That everythin' is workin' out like obliques, they wanna see it obese
You drive me crazy you gon' crash the 'vert
Get out my business why you act like a clerk
I got a white girl she call me names like bastard and jerk
That's when I send her ass back to the 'burbs
Fucked her right good night, die wit' em open
I'm wit' a big booty bitch dressed inappropriate
Cocaine, bakin' soda and some hot water
Kept the fiends comin' back to me, not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like I'll be out tomorrow, keep the Glock on 'em
All eyes on me, I had a Pac moment
This a Mannie Fresh beat and I go Pac on it
My homeboys proud of me like Barack homies
Your homeboys tired of me, I hope they die yawnin'
Leave ya house haunted
I ain't kiddin', I ain't playin', fuck up your house party
Lil Tunechi

[Interlude: Ashanti & Lil Wayne]
So DJ, won’t you play some more songs?
‘Cause we ain’t got nowhere to go home
Yeah, we ain’t got nowhere to go wrong
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh
So DJ, won’t you play some more songs?
‘Cause we ain’t got nowhere to go but home
Yeah, we ain’t got nowhere to go but wrong
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Got you, Ashanti)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Just a watch and a mink coat, yeah
Wherever I spit at a tree grow
I’m a blood with some C-notes
And I’m gettin' more checks than a peep hole
Yo, I done been through hell and back on a steamboat
Met the devil, came back feelin' frío
Gang bangin’, tatted up like Latinos
And since I’m on my Spanish shit, it’s Carter Cinco
Mami is bionic and bisexual, bilingual
Mami is a goddess, but she gotta let her wings show
Mami tryna fuck me with her team, that’s a team sport
All these bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain’t seen yours
Muscle car look like I just got out the bing, whoa
Drop the top, smell like I just opened a weed store
A nice beat mixed with Tunechi like a cream float 
With Mannie Fresh the O.G., now it's a G.O.!

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Ashanti]
Luh-uh-uh
Yeah, got the squad in this bitch in case it pop off
Lu-uh
Fresh, can you please tell these niggas
I’ve been rich since the Hot Boys
Luh-uh-uh
Bad ass dog by the screen door
Lu-uh
Your girl walkin’ ‘round my house wearin' nothin' but my watch and my mink coat
Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh
Yeah, now everybody throw a five, throw a five, Carter Cinco
Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh
And since I’m on my Spanish shit, them other boys finito

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne & Mack Maine, Ashanti]
Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh
We gon' start this shit off right
We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh
We gon' start this shit off right (Yeah)
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

[Chorus: Mack Maine & Lil Wayne, Ashanti]
Luh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-huh
We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
Bitches outside, them some sad ass bitches, leggo (Yea, leggo, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
In the restroom in the mirror takin' pictures, alright, yeah
That’s alright, yeah, that’s alright, yeah, that’s alright, yeah

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
Couple niggas trippin’, mean muggin’, makin’ fistses, alright
It’s alright, but we don’t fight, no
Welcome

[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

[Verse 1]
Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percocets, that's my buttons, hit the pop button
Psychopath, blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smokin' science lab
I should have a tattoo that say, "I am nothin' like my dad"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, "Oooh, Lordy," smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin’ emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin’ (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say, "Timber," please, will you whisper?
My nigga, I'm quietly fallin', shhhhh

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Bridge]
Hello? Hello? Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong, I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, "Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free"
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab
I should have tattoo that say, "I'm nothin' like your man"
Jesus Christ, Amen!
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

[Refrain]
You got penny pinch nigga problems, lil whoadie
On the bench nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got a bitch nigga problem, lil whoadie
More bitches more problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
What is this nigga problem, lil whoadie?
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Yea

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

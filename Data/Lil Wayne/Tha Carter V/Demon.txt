[Verse 1]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you

[Chorus]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon, I demand you
You brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man, you
Brought the demon out the man, ooh

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Bridge 2]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

[Chorus 2]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon by demand too
Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

[Verse 2]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge 3]
A demon, with demands
A demon, with demands

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Outro]
Brought the demon out her ass too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic, demonic
Demon with demands, demon with demands
Demon with demands, demon with demands

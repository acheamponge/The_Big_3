[Intro]
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror, my 'migo
Crème de la crème de la Créole
Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
Yeah It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Man in the mirror, my hero
He got me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

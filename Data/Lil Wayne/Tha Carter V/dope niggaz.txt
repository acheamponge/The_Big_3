[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em - It's that "Carter V", let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas somewhere with me in these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch, you played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga, get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Lil Wayne]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin', you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

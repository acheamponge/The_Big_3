[Verse 1]
Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands
My gang popping niggas
Smoke that Kiesha, not that Reggie
For you name dropping niggas
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say "Bad Bitches Only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go pew
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah all my niggas nuts and I'm a loose screw
Bitch I get big bucks, pockets on Bruce Bruce
Yeah I talk that shit, bitch I got bread, bitch I got toast
Welcome to The Murder Show — I am the motherfucking host
They call me Weezy F. Baby, yes I do the fucking most
I'm at their throats until they choke
The God has spoke
I need a smoke, man
(Smoke break…)

[Hook 1]
Now let it breathe to 'em
It go; all these bitches, and niggas still hating
I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems
I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man
All these bitches and niggas still hating
Yeah I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems
I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man

[Verse 2]
It go; dark-ass shades, I can't see them haters
Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shaun White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I don't fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers "Bombs away"

[Hook 2]
Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
Man, I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later
And life is a bitch, but I appreciate her
Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
And I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gateing
Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later
Man, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her

[Outro]
Let it breathe tune
Just let it breathe tune, yeah
Young, Young Mula, baby
Young Mula, baby
Young, Young Mula, baby
Just let it breathe tune

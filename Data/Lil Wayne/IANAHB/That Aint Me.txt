[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up please

Yeah, I shall never leave Hip-Hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tick tock
Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord — I am God’s own
Back to my hands, tick-tick; a time bomb

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool
Before that, it was a livin' cesspool
We gotta get on our shit, like gnats do
Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do
And in this game, nobody’s on my plateau
Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-D-man Junior, or — Weezy F. Baby, baby

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

[Bridge: Jay Sean]
That ain't me
See I won’t stop, that ain't me
I won't quit, that ain't me
No, I won't stop, that ain't me
Cause that ain't me

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Alright; alright, alright, alright
I’m in their conversations
The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

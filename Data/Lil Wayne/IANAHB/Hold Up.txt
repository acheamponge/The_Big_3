[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Leggo, Ok
Bitch I’m me, American Gangster
Weezy F. Baby, born in a manger
Trouble is my friend, I ain’t foreign to danger
Clip full of wings, turn you boys into angels
Shoot you in your halo, shoot you like Halo
New Orleans a-hole; frio, fuego
All about my bread like bagels, they know
I’m raw like Quaaludes
Bal' like gay hoes
Weed so strong it’s like I twist tornadoes
Spit like nines, four-fifths, and three-eight-0s
Niggas want problems, well I am problematic
It’s back to picking cotton, cause you niggas cotton candy
I’m a Eastside Damu
Deep water Shamu
Shoot you from your head to your shoulders, shampoo
Kush in the bamboo
Pussy in the bedroom
Pass that bitch down like an heirloom
Tunechi

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Hold up, hold up
Wait a minute
Hold up, hold up
Man, we hustle 'til night fall
Party 'til sunlight
Guns in the boxers
Don’t make this a gun fight
Fuck them other niggas
I fuck them niggas bitches
Benadryl shit
Trigger finger itching
And we hustle 'til night fall
Party 'til sunlight
Guns in the boxers
Don’t make this a gun fight
Fuck them other niggas
I fuck them niggas bitches
Benadryl shit
Trigger finger itching
Hold up
Hold up
Wait a minute
Hold up
Hold up

[Verse 2: T-Streets]
Maan, bitch I’m Streets, I rep that East
Gimme the beef, I’ll put the beef in the grease
Kush in the sweets, your bitch in the sheets
I fucked that bitch: mission complete
Real nigga talk, gangsta conversation
I’m a real nigga, don’t fuck with imitations
Young Money nigga, ain’t no limitations
I don’t play games, niggas simulation
Which one of y’all niggas say you bout it
It’s a fucked up world T-Streets take you out it
That’s word to the Glock
Glock in the sock
Loose lips sink ships, better stop at the dock
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Married to the money, you welcome to the reception
And she came with problems; fuck it, that’s my stepsons
Sleeping in the Maybach, wake me when the jet come
And I keep the toast, turn your ass to bread crumbs, uh
Based on a true story
I got a million flows, they ain’t even two stories
Sleeping on the edge, I hope I don’t toss and turn
Shoot down the early bird, and that’s how I get the worm
Yeah, Real Nigga University Alumni
Just checked my watch, and that bitch said sometimes
She say when I’m in her, it feel like I’m soul-searching
And they say money talks, well it’s my spokesperson, uh
Grab a star from the sunroof
I fuck her in her dreams, and make her come true
Yeah, Young Money and the power
Send my B's at you, like a motherfucking flower
Hold Up

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

Man, we hustle 'til night fall

Party 'til sunlight
Guns in the boxers
Don’t make this a gun fight
Fuck them other niggas

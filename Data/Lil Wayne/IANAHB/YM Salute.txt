[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Verse 1: Lil' Twist]
So sick with the flow
Yeah your cowboys know that Lil Twist
Been a pro way before Romo or T.O
No Witten, Cowboys to a Piston
A.I., no Wallace, your kids gettin' demolished
I’m bookin' on your suckers like I'm just leaving college
But smart, very smart - too smart for your knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It’s YME, nothin' gets in between us

[Verse 2: Lil' Chuckee]
Tell Wayne I’m goin' in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game, nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rockin' with Young Money
I told my team I got us man, it’s all on me
Like Volume two B.G., I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Every time I’m on the track it’s ransom
Can’t find us anymore, it’s random
When Young Money come through you better salute us

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Hey I solemnly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never got to call me cause I’mma be there
Let's get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shell toes
Strapped like Velcro and is we running hell no
And truthfully, aimin' for number one, oh do we
You ask why I reply 'cause nobody remember two or three
Cross YM out of him we'll make a movie
We all we can be, respect the army and salute we

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money army, we marching
We coming forward, no warning
We got these boys running like Forrest
So salute me like a general
First place, never last
Always on top and I’m a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in a stranglehold​ no letting up
You can get the top of your can popped like 7-Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
I’ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers, I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me
Cause Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Commander-in-Chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the world, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don’t ask me about shit but money
Fuckin’ right my money long I got that 10-foot money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I’m in deep like wet pussy
I’m a purple heart proven war vet, rookie
You can’t even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don’t step to me
Now don’t step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain’t we God’s children?
I know at all times gods feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
Salute - or shoot

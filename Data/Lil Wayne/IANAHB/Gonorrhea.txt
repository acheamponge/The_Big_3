I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on
Back against the wall, and my two feet is what I stand on

[Verse 3: Drake]
I am spending much more than I’m making
On these cars and these vacations, is that too much information?
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing
With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station
I am tryna figure out why you so mad at me
Yes, I’m with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery
(Okay) Nigga peep the shit I’m wyling on
I be with your baby mama, you be with your child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone
(Okay) I will break your fucking collar bone

Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on
And we about to kill 'em, C4, Mr. Carter's home

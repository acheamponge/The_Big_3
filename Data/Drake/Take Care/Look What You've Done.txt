[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...

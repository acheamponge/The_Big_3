[Verse 1]
She says, "Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic, don’t I? I get it poppin’, don’t I?
I’ll end up stoppin', won’t I? And by the time I end up stoppin'
You’ll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out
While shoppin' with a nigga, don’t lie
She’s losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes: don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make
I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
She is here and we're so gone
Oh
Oh, oh, oh

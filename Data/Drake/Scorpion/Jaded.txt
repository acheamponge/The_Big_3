[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Leaving me (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (Quickly) learned yourself through me (Through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
I guess (Yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (Ooh yeah)
Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (Ooh yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody (Body) yeah

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things I don't wanna say (Jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (Say)
I wanna be around while you chasin'
(Wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (Ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous)
You got somethin' real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around, dangerous, oh, ooh yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')

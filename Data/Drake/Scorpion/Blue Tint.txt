Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

[Chorus: Drake]
Look who I'm fuckin' again
I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now, does she sink or swim?

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Future]
She had an attitude in the summer
But she bein' nice again (She bein' nice)
Double my price again (Double my price)
Top of the charts, back in they hearts
Nigga, he strikes again, whoa
Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa

[Verse 1: Drake]
Way this shit set up I live like Ronaldo
But I never been in Madrid, whoa
She said that that she workin', I told her come over
And we can get right at the crib, whoa
She finish at 6 but then say she got court in the morning to fight for her kid
I told her I'd pray for the kid

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Future]
What a time this is (Whoa)
To be alive for this shit (Yeah)
President doin' us in (Woo)
My window got blue in the tint (Skrrt)
Did this shit once and I'd do it again

[Chorus: Drake]
Look who I'm fuckin' again
I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now, does she sink or swim?

[Refrain: Future & Drake]

I got blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Look who I'm stuck with again
I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get so thin
Now, does she sink or does she swim, now?

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Future]
Ayy, 'cause she bein' nice again (She bein' nice)
Double my price again (Double my price)
Top of the charts, back in they hearts
Nigga, he strikes again, whoa
Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
Nobody better to show up and run it
And I could put that on the twins, whoa
We not together but I get the info on you
'Cause I'm nice to your friends
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, they shouldn't have told me but they did

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
What a time this is (Whoa)

My window got blue in the tint (Skrrt)
Ayy, did this shit once and I'd do it again

[Chorus: Drake]
Look who I'm fuckin' again
I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now, does she sink or swim?

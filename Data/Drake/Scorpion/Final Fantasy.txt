[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

[Interlude]
Did somebody…
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!

[Verse 2]
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeah

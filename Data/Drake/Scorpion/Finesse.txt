[Intro]
Yeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all theâ€“
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (Yeah)

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Verse 2]
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

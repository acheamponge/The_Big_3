[Intro: Drake]
[knocking on the door]
DJ Paul
TWhy
Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
(Dopeman!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

[Chorus: Drake]
Woo! You know what I'm sayin'?
Woo! Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)

[Bridge: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Yo, get close enough to HOV, smell like a kilo still (Still)
First album 26, I ain't need no deal (Real)
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne (Woo!)
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done

[Chorus: Drake]
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Bridge: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

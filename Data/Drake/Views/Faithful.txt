[Intro: Pimp C, Drake & Amber Rose]
Check, one-two, one-two, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
'Cause they feel like they know me (they know me)
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game (Game)
This ain't no motherfucking 91
We out here rapping for money, you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
(In this shit but Bun)

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
You would think it's all mine the way I took it (Yeah)
You would think it broke down the way I push it (Yeah)
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't? (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 2: Drake]
You hit me like "I know youâ€™re there with someone else" (Yeah)
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text (Yeah)
I want to get straight to the climax (Straight, straight to the)
Yeah, have you coming all summer like a season pass (Yeah)
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back (Yeah)
'Cause you talk like you got what I need (Yeah)
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze (Yeah)
Talk like you bet it all on me (Yeah)
And you can't take no Ls off me
I know you been

[Chorus: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 3: dvsn]
How far we go always seems to get better with time, hey
Won't ya, outsmart me, no
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know ya (I'll get to know you again)
You want me to show ya (I'm gonna show you again)
Now we're in the zone, yeah (Gon' let me all in again, ooh)
And now you're coming over
(Over and over and over and over and over again)
Over and over again, over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again, over and over again
You tell me I should know ya (But I'll get to know you again)
And you want me to show ya, uh (I'm gonna show you again)
When were in the zone you (Gon' let me own it again)
And now you're coming over

Now you're coming over, you're coming over

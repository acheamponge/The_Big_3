[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in

[Interlude: Future]
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You actin' like you fuckin' won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up

[Chorus: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Verse 2: Future]
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

[Chorus: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

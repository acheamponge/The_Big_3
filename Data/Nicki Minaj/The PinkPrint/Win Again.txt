[Verse 1]
I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of MoÃ«t
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, cause I came out
'09, when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cuttin' school and stayin' out
I been hotter than, vacationin' and layin' out
I sat back and watched how it was playin' out
They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website but get money, this is fifty
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Soon as I came in, I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali of these bitches, and that can't be debated
I never chicken'd out, skated, I know they mad that I made
All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

[Bridge]
So good, so real, so good, yeah
I'ma win again
I'ma win again, yeah
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you?"
Yeah, I know that they mad
But I'ma shit on my critics some more

[Outro]
I am, I am
I am still gonna do, what he sent me to do
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
They know I am a champion
All champions do
It's all champions do

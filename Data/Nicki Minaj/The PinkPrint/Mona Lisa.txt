[Intro]
You make me, you make me small
You make me
(I ain't worried 'bout a...)

[Chorus]
If you look at my
If you look at my love
You'll see
You'll see I ain't worried about a he
See
I ain't worried about a he
I ain't worried about a he
I ain't never take a knee 'cause he ain't worry 'bout me
If you look at my
If you look at my love
I ain't worried about a he
And he ain't worry 'bout me
Live for my love
'Cause he ain't worry 'bout me
Live for my love, me
I ain't never take a knee 'cause he ain't worry 'bout me

[Verse]
You make me feel blue
You don't make me feel super
You don't make me feel super (You don't make me feel super)
Look at me, me
He ain't worried about me
And I don't pick up dead leaves
He ain't worried about me, see
If it's you and me then it's you and me
Baby, we don't worry about keys
You make me, make me feel stuck
You don't give two fucks
You ain't worried bout me, you just tryna bust nuts
Time's up
All that bullshit lines up
All that talkin 'bout what you gon' do
Boy, go and get ya mind up

[Chorus]
If you look at my
If you look at my love
You'll see
You'll see I ain't worried about a he
See
I ain't worried about a he
I ain't worried about a he
I ain't never take a knee 'cause he ain't worry 'bout me
If you look at my
If you look at my love
I ain't worried about a he
And he ain't worry 'bout me
Live for my love
'Cause he ain't worry 'bout me
Live for my love, me
I ain't never take a knee 'cause he ain't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
(You make me)
I don't wanna fight but I'll fuck around and shoot you
I don't wanna fight but you gave me no more trust
I will fuck around and end your life

[Chorus]
If you look at my
If you look at my love
You'll see
You'll see I ain't worried about a he
See
I ain't worried about a he
I ain't worried about a he
I ain't never take a knee 'cause he ain't worry 'bout me

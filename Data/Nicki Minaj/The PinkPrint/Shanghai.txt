[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Yung Berg]
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya, r-r-roll up on ya
Roll up on ya, r-r-r-r-roll up on ya

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, eight mil' on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string
Ain’t fucking with you bitch niggas, and that’s real rap but I do sing
Make room when I come by, ain’t speaking, I’m dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it’s a matter of time before one die
‘Cause them dudes out and them tools out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick that I’m winter fresh
They’ll get chewed out
‘Cause them dudes out and them tools out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick that I’m winter fresh
They’ll get chewed out
This shit ain’t regular rich, so they end up in a ditch
I’m not a regular bitch
So when niggas see me, they jump on my dick
He not a regular shooter, so when you see me, salute her
Ain’t got a knife in my hand
But I’m choppin’ it up with some niggas from Cuba

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Yung Berg]
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya, r-r-roll up on ya
Roll up on ya, r-r-r-r-roll up on ya

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ask Jay who he married, eighty thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie got 'em aggy
These bitches is light-weight
I’m always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate
Cause we move work through that Tri-State
‘Cause them boys out, and them toys out
Still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time
Or that May-weather, like Floyd’s out
‘Cause them boys out, and them toys out
Still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time
Or that May-weather, like Floyd’s out
All of these bitches in pocket
I’m ‘bout to make a deposit
Tell ‘em to go ‘head and gossip
As long as your house is the size of my closet
Anybody I call, they picks up
Even if they was gettin’ they dick sucked
These niggas don’t make a mix-up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
(Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Yung Berg]
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya, r-r-roll up on ya
Roll up on ya, r-r-r-r-roll up on ya

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]

[Intro]
Zaytoven
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Everytime I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
'Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I-I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who-who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want-want-want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
'Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said, “Thank you”
I'm popping tags every day, it look like my b-day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches “BJ”
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (My name)
My name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King
I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash Money, getting six albums, no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want-want-want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
'Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more

[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I said I didn’t love you, I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you, I lied, I lied

[Chorus]
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Verse 1]
Even though I said don’t touch me, I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said "Let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cutting them brake lines

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? who knows? So, I lied

[Chorus]
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Verse 2]
Even though I said "Fuck you," I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

[Bridge]
I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool, I, I'm not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you
So I lied, I lied, I lied

[Chorus]
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Outro]
I lied, ooh baby
Ooo-ooh
'Cause what if I just let myself go with you?
It’s all good now, goodbye love
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever

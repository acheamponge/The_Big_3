[Chorus]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 1]
Every time I come and fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real?
Or are you plotting to kill?
I tell you just how I feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that?
Now you wanna leave and never come back
I don't control you, I ain't never say that
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back

[Chorus]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 2]
Every time I try to fuck with you
Nothing ain't ever enough for you
And I had all this hope for you
But all you do is open wounds
I could be fucking with them other niggas
And no you ain't them other niggas
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches
Just my real bitches
Why you keep talking about it
You keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy
If she could cut her wrist off
I ain't finna lie, no I ain't finna lie
Like it was just his fault
But I know if a nigga lose me
Then nigga, ooh-wee, that's his loss, young nigga

[Chorus]
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got a shopping problem, she got a shopping problem
I'm a compulsive shopper so I'mma cop her Prada
I'm a ice her outta, make you talk about her
She got this thang about her, yeah, she's a sexy walker
We shopping in Morocco, I took her to Dubai
Lil mama stupid fly, so tell me what you like, 'cause girls I like to buy
My money stupid fat, his money on a diet
Ten stacks to keep her quiet
I make her call me Daddy, yeah there go Daddy, baby
And she loves Daddy 'cause Daddy gone keep them hating
Yeah, they hating, baby, they wanna trade places
I call her sexy lady, she call me Gucci, baby

[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I'ma need a couple of them Benzeses
I be out in China spendin yens-eses
Gucci on my lenses-es
My leather so sensitive
Scratch my 9 o' clock
I wanna shop, make it tentative
Dilly dilly d, look at all these hoochies
I be on the beach in Emilio Pucci
I'm the best, I'm the best, ask Khaled
Sorry little daddy, that card's not valid
I need unlimited black cards like I'm racist
Some real big faces, Louis Vuitton cases
Hoes in the hood say "Nicki Minaj bougie"
I do it B.I.G. so I keep a couple CooGies, hoes

[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers

She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic


[Verse 3: Bobby V]
Louis V, fuck with me, every day's a shopping spree
Got ice that be clear like glass, I be freakin' blindin' me
My level's hard to see, best to just admire me
Everywhere I go, she go
I go to the sto' just to blow big dough
She got a Louis problem, Louis this and Louis that
Louis hanging from her arm, in her purse, a Louis strap
Big cash is everywhere, haters love to stop and stare
Fly from the shoes to hair, so fucking hate, I don't care
She all about the money, she all about the cash
She all about me, Bobby, 'cause I be serving that ass
I be serving the hard, she be serving me back
I just give her the card, ain't no limit on that

[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic

[Verse 4: F1JO]
Silly me, buying all this Louis V
True Religions, rocking Republic, 7's and Frankie B
Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Escada, Dolce and Gabbana
Long as I'mma keep buying designer she's a rider
Scooped her out of that Nissan, threw her in a Hummer truck
Four wheel drive when you ride, you ain't never stuck
Who is he? Could it be? Young Joey, he gotta be
Honestly the hottest 'cause when you shop there ain't no stoppin' me
I ain't seen no black cards, all I know is push 'em in
Prada gotta block, 100ft cops tryna scuff my Timbalands
Goddamn, I love them haters, stepping on my Maury kids
Me muggin' a Gucci truck, sorta like a [?]



[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic

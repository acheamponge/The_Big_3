Okay so I'm gonna just, you know, briefly run down my shoutouts
Shoutout to all of the DJs that's ever showed Nicki Minaj love
I love you right back
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, you know
Just 'cause he has really nice eyes
And, you know, he's really sexy and all that
Um, shout out to my baby Big Mike and Trapaholics
And Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama
Um, I also have a very crazy manager
Her name is Debra Antney
And um, she's psychotic, she's bipolar, um
But nevertheless she's mine, all mine
Oh, I have to share her with Gucci Mane
And I have to share her with, OJ Juice
And I have to share her with the So Icey boys
And, you know, Waka Flocka Flame and all that but
You know she's all mine, anyway

[Verse 1]
Hear the Devil callin', I can hear 'em
It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess
Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you."
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply
Yellin' "Rasta, alright! " when I'm ridin' by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king
Back when I was smugglin' them things, in the bing
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding!

[Chorus]
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'



[Bridge]
Get down, get down, get down down
Get d- get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down on the ground
Get down, get down on the ground

[Verse 2]
Man, fuck a P-O, and fuck a C-O
'Bout to "Set It Off", like Cleo
Mad, they done tapped my Treo
Bagged my skio, heard the bitch lyin' like Leo
Anyway, I'm the ninja, Kawasaki blazin'
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done
Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin'
The young Chaka Khan, yes - "I Am Every Woman"
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

[Chorus]
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'


[Outro]
Can you hear the yellin'?
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me

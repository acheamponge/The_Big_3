[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Verse 1]
Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause I pack shows, sell ticks like Boston
Pat your back, ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my straitjacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?
Just 'cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex
M-Mark it with an X, they talkin' them checks now, now, now



[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Verse 2]
Why did you envy? Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why, when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go "Ding!"


[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Bridge]
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me-e-e-e-e?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh)
I'm on a go, I'm on a go, yeah
But, bad gyal, try to stop my flow, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm fine, I'm fine


[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

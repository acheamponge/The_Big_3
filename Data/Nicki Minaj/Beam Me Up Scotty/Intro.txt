You know, a lot of people ask me why I feel that, you know, I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And I don’t know, people seem to be under the impression that I’ve made it to this point fast
And, you know, obviously for me, I don’t feel like that
'Cause it's me, you know? I feel like I’ve been doing it for ten billion years
But every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for you know getting me this far
'Cause sometimes you don’t realize how far you’ve gotten
Until you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not going to be about my talent, you know?
It's not going to be about connections
It’s not gonna be about my looks
It's gonna be about who wants it the most
And I want it the most

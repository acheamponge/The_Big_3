[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You know they say who, who is Nicki Minaj?
You know I'm like a multiple personality bitch
Like, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a ninja, I'm a boss
I'm, I'm the Harajuku Barbie!

[Chorus: Sasha]
Who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell me who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, moan and groan
Admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I just heard that I was the baddest in the town
So I came down and had to pick up my crown
Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub
That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns
Yao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians
Sayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin'
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans
Call Wyclef, I'm a need a couple Haitians
Now where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?
My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bod gal, all my Guyanese?



[Chorus: Sasha]
Who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell me who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, moan and groan
Admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just found out that I was doper than Amy
Winehouse, maybe
Fresh out the navy
Fresher then a daisy
Used to be on Baisley
Young money bunny bitch please say the baby
Please stop callin' me, I'm such a rock star
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar?
Give 'em my keys, tell 'em valet my car
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far
Now all I need is a real mandingo
Gimme good uhh and distribute my single
Bootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur?


[Chorus: Sasha]
Who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell me who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, moan and groan
Admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Ahh, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-wa wine
My wine is too dutty
C'yeah, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-ba wine
My wine is too dutty

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
One, two, buckle my shoe
No one on the corner has swagger like I do
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I got the 45 special, don't worry
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry
I like mi chicken and mi goat with curry(yeah)
Now, where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?
My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bad gal, all my Guyanese?


[Chorus: Sasha]
Who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell me who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, moan and groan
Admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Ahh, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-wa wine
My wine is too dutty
C'yeah, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-ba wine
My wine is too dutty

[Outro: Sasha]
Now tell admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, moan and groan
Admit it, me say me moan and groan
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it

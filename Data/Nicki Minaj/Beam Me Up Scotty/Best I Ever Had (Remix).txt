[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Yeah, Drizzy's home, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Know you got a roommate, call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat, and you know I'll be over there (Yup!)
I'll be over there, shawty I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha! And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to never get confused with, 'cause...



[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, you the only one that see the real Nicki
I can show you "Chill Nicki" 'cause of how you deal wit me
When they knock my blocks down
You come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, you still fuckin' real Drizzy
It's so amazing
I figured out this world is ours with the taking
I figured out that when I go out and all those people scream
That's some of them are living vicariously through me
That's why I put that "S" on my chest and I'm gone
But on another note, let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg, 'cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I'll be there around eleven
So let me put my books down (Down)
Excuse me if I look down (Down)
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I'm at your service
Look at what you took down (Down)


[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, other niggas never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say the same thing, every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...

[Verse 3: Drake]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double-cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix? Then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots
I'm saying!


[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)

[Outro: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
Ugh! Aww, yeah! (Aww, yeah)
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
(This is...)
Just make sure they that special somebody (An essay)
Young Money! (...Baby!)
Yeah, yeah

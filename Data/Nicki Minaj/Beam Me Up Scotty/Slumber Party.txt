[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Banana boat full of blow
Banana clip to cut ya throat
Banana dro, come take a smoke
Banana diamonds, yellow stone
Heavy snow, that berry blow
That cherry coke got stupid dough
Plenty mo', you think I booked a
Hundred, shows I'm selling dope
I'm into wishin rolling kushin
Sippin lean and burnin piff
You gotta fifth, I gotta pint
You took a shot, I took a sip
I plead the 5th, ain't saying shit
Go get my lawyer, get him quick
Spent 80 grand to beat a case
I whipped it like my purple whip
I call a hit like Sosa did
Them killas blitz ya house ya monkey
I got so much jewelry on me
Still you can't take nothing from me
Hook it up, I cook it up
And get some head while rolling blunts
Water paint, water stain
I'm lookin' down, she lookin' up
Beamer truck, I rim it up
Spent 80 thou', 400 stones
She suck a dick while rollin' blunt
She keep the boss man bustin' nuts
I get it off, she get it up
Me and her both can't get enough
We in the goat, I'm in the ghost
I'm tryna beat that pussy up


[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Welcome to my private party
More hoes than a bachelor party
Smoking, drinking, freaking
Shit can turn into a slumber party
You can't meet my mama, uh-uh
But here you go, my number, shawty
When you feeling freaky, mama
We can have a slumber party
A slumber party
Mama, have a slumber party
You can't meet my mama, uh-uh
But here you go, my number, shawty
When you feeling freaky, mama
We can have a slumber party
We can have a slumber party
We can have a—yeah

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Her negligees are Burberry
Her lingerie game very straight
Her oral sex is very wet
My sex so great she gainin' weight
I cook a cake, she cook a steak
We three estates, you Section 8
Stay out her face, she hardly date
She fuckin' Gucci, shawty, damn!
Everyday's a ballin' day
Just yesterday we bought a lake
Tomorrow bought us 2 Camaros
'08 and a '68
We trappin' fast with stupid cash
So rap on with your stupid ass
It's Gucci Mane, no stupid ass
I keep on making stupid cash

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Got that Super Soaker
Pussy pop like Cola Coca
Plus it's tighter than a choker
Got him smilin' like the Joker
Got that ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne
Little Mermaid on my linen
When yo mama sleepin'
You can call me and get all up in it
Bank rolls
Get me all them pretty furs
Cause my pussy game cold
When he hit it he say burr
He say b-b-b-b-bur
I'ma I'ma marry her
And he p-lay with that purr (pearl)
Like he strummin' his guitar
That's me, I am Minaj
I am Ni-Nicki Minaj
And if you want a ménage
Keep a couple pretty broads
Look, head game busy busy
Make a nigga dizzy dizzy
Bitch, I'm at that slumber party
Sippin on that frizzy chrissy

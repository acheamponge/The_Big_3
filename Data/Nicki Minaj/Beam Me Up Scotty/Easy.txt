[Intro: Gucci Mane & Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, uh huh
Go, burr, hah, talk to 'em, Nicki
I mean, you know, ain't really much to say
Hah, So Icey in this bitch
You know, they know what the fuck it is, So Icey in the motherfuckin' buildin'
Bling, blaw, burr
Gucci, my nigga Rocko, I am Nicki Minaj
So Icey Princess again, you already know
Go, nigga, go!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Dammit it's a miracle, please adjust the temperature
I switched up the interior in my European vehicle
Damn Gucci lyrical, nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria, with brand new material
Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago
With three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was [?] same color as a prune
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Room, hear it ert-ert when it skrt
26's on the skirt's and a bird with a flirt
You can chirp, I got twerk, I keep work in my birds
I got bird, I got brees, I got pounds of that herbs
"Yeahhhh" used to be my favorite word now my ice game is superb
So them hoes be just like, "Burr, burr"


[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Gucci Mane]
Daddy tryin' hard, but it's easy (Huh)
Tightenin' up on your job, 'cause it's easy (Huh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Poom Poom! (Uh)
Nine-five-four, double R, zoom zoom (Kyuh)
I don’t give a fuck about you Looney Tune goons (No)
Yelling boom boom, when you're really poon-poon (Ew)
I eat these rap bitches, no fork, no spoon (Haha)
I'm Nicki, I'm finicky, I’m picky
I stay around the six like that little mouse, Mickey
Ask Rocko, ask Gucci, ask Gucci, Gucci bandana (Uh)
I'm a star, I'm the black Hannah Montana (Woo)
I’m such a girl, I’m such a girly girl (Yes)
I'm sippin' on my milkshake, with the swirly swirl (Okay)
Excuse me, mister, put some cherries in my cups (Why?)
I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts (Ow!)
The boys go nuts, the boy–boys go nuts (Uh-huh)
All the dope boys, all the boys wanna fuck (Yeah)
My nigga S. Beezy keep my wrist breezy (Uh-huh)
Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy? (Mwah)

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Man, I'ma step my swag up, don't fly commercial, I'm private
Step my rank up, so salute me, fuckin' private
Remember the days I used to keep my coat in my private
Now I'm with my partners smokin' kush on autopilot
I just bought a boat, and I don't even know how to drive it
But it's all gravy, I just coast on autopilot
I'm on another coast, you ain't even in my time zone
By the time you go to bed, I'm gettin' my shine on
Yeah, it's all good, baby, go on and climb on
Then ride it like a rodeo, get your grind on
Tell how I spend money, I be gettin' my grind on
Tell how I'm limpin' when I walk, I got my .9 on
Ayy, your girl lovin' you, but she with me, know what her mind on?
Don't make me do it hard, I get it done, it cost a dime, homie
Watch fifty stacks, and it don't even have a diam' on
Rocko The Don, I done got my time gone


[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Gucci Mane]
Daddy tryin' hard, but it's easy (Huh)
Tightenin' up on your job, 'cause it's easy (Huh)
I’m Nicki Minaj, so be easy (Yeah)
Gucci Mane and Rocko, please believe it (Huh)
Daddy tryin' hard, but it's easy (Huh)
Tightenin' up on your job, 'cause it's easy (Huh)
I’m Nicki Minaj, so be easy (Yeah)
Gucci Mane and Rocko, please believe it (Huh)

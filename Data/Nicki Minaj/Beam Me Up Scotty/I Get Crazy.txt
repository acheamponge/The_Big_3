[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That's-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
You bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof, flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they singing the “Star Spangled Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner”
And I, I am the rap Hannah Mo-Mon-Montana
So fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
A-And I’m, and I’m flyer then reindeers in the winter




[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
So I got a bad-bitch mentality
'Cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the Oval Office, then the lights out
'Cause I am the Wicked Witch, I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I mean, I'm Nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean, my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean Tinker, tell that nigga link her
'Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy


[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
1, 2, 3rd floor, hospital bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I'm fly, now eat my bird shit
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm lookin' for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F Baby, no, Weezy F Crazy

[Chorus]
I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy
I-I get crazy

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
When I do it, it get did-ed, I was fixing my fitted
Pull up in a 6 Series, she was fixing your Civic
When I do it, it gets done, 2 sticks in my bun
Pull up in a 6, hun, you was fixing to run, hoe
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
(You know, you know my name is Nicki Minaj, trick)
(Let's get it)
I get crazy, I get crazy
I get motherfuckin', motherfuckin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, that's what my name is
My name means crazy in cr-crazy language

[Intro: K'Duce]
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass—

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I employ these niggas
They be grown men, but I Little Boy these niggas
Want the cookie, so I gotta Chips Ahoy these niggas
But I never iPhone, Android these niggas
Use rubbers with 'em, I 'on't ever raw these niggas
More money than 'em, I'ma son all these niggas
I ain't shoppin' but it's like I gotta store these niggas
Put 'em on time-out and never call these niggas
P-p-p-pussy like girls, damn, is my pussy gay?
It's a holiday, Play-With-My-Pussy Day
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy taken
Pussy ride dick like she a Jamaican
Pussy stay warm, pussy on vacation
You loose bitches need a pussy renovation
Y-y-you could eat it with a pussy reservation
P-p-pussy 'bout to get a standin' ovation
Clap, clap, clap for this pussy, nigga
But I can't give this pussy to a pussy nigga
Aw, man, slow down
I'ma get you something that you could hold down
But I can't give you head, I'm too ill for that
I'ma make a movie still, Kill Bill for that
'Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga, custom down?
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot, bust me down?
You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?
Now you all up in the sauce 'cause you wanna be down?
I said, rule number one to be a boss ass bitch
Never let a clown nigga try to play you
If he play you then, rule number two
Fuck his best friends then make 'em yes-men
And get a dick pic and then you press send
And send a red heart and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends love how your pussy taste
And that's rule three, I'm the school tea'
My wrist look like I am a jewel thief
But that's just 'cause I am a boss bitch
Now macaroni cheese and grill my swordfish



[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-if he catch my drift, he could catch my jizz
I be out in Cali runnin' all my businesses
I be out in Cali watchin' back my Christmas vids
Every time I fuck 'em, yes, I tell him this is his
Looked down at it, and I said, "This is big"
Man, my game so cold I said, "This is rigged"
Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell 'em bitches, cross they "t"s and dot they "i"s
I-I-I-I-I-I-I came back, bitches' flows still boring
I said, "Damn, man, go back to whoring"
You know I still lead the league in scoring
You know I'm still bad and I'm still foreign
I-I-I'ma give bitches time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York Knickerbock'
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot, oh
But on the real, I'm in album mode
Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound


[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
I hear you
When I'm back on the prowl
You bitches better have my money
'Cause I'm coming for you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it? I'll go rich bitch off
'Cause you know my style gettin' bit, ripped off
When I'm at the restaurant, rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, I got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it? I'll go rich bitch off
And you know my style gettin' bit, ripped off
Off, off, off, off, off, off, off
I'm a b—, I'm a boss

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Ask Lil Wayne who the five-star bitch is
Ask Lil Wayne who the five-star bitch is
Ask Lil Wayne, ask Lil Wayne
Ask Lil Wayne who the five-star bitch is
Ask Birdman who the five-star bitch is
Ask Young Money who the five-star bitch is
Who the five-star bitch is, who the five-star bitch is
Ask Birdman who the five-star bitch is
Ask Lil Wayne, ask Lil Wayne
Ask Lil Wayne who the five-star bitch is

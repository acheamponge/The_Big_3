[Intro]
You know, it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj

[Verse 1]
I ain't know the president live in DC
And I ain't know they call me Nicki Lewinsky
I never knew that dude with Jay was Pimp C
And I ain't know I be with Paris and Lindsay
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
I fly girl pop up, and I fly girl dip
I fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip
And I don't never guzzle it, I fly girl sip

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that Rosé, get that, get that Rosé
A little Hennessy and Louis the 13th
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all my haters 'cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now

[Chorus]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do




[Hook]
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ
If he don't p-p-pull up, let the record replay
Record replay, r-r-record replay
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ

[Verse 2]
I ain't know the police was the Babylon
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties was bigger than Pamela
So paparazzi flicking, be flicking their camera
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ
A little cranberry and some Rémy Moné
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all the haters cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now

[Chorus]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do


[Hook]
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ
If he don't pull up let the record replay
Record replay, record replay
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ

[Bridge]
Fuck 'em like sexin', why they be flexing
When they know that this they song?
So interesting, fronting like they texting
Damn, them bitches got me wrong
Got me wrong wrong wrong
Got me w-w-w-w-w-wrong
Got me w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wrong

[Chorus]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do

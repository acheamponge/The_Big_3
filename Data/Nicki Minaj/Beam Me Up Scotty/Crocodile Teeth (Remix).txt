[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Mmm, mmm, ayo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
First thing I'ma do when I pop out
Is tell my nigga, "Yo, make sure you got the Glock out"
I just hopped out lookin' like a knock-out (Out)
Showed these bitches how to do it, but they dropped out
Yep, yep, bling-bling if the watch out (Out)
Tell 'em "watch out," I brought the block out
Talk shit, but when they see me, it's a cop-out (Mmm, cop-out)
They don't get the big picture, they get cropped out
Styles on 'em like somebody brought The LOX out (LOX out)
Headline tours, and I bring Fox' out (Fox' out)
If it's a calm flex, then I bring the Crocs out
Might tuck a gyal man, I know the opps out (Opps out)
Dem bright, fuck I look like in your eyesight? (Eyesight)
Gyal I tried, but it not quite right (Quite right)
They wan' fight cuh I treat 'em with hype (With hype)
Them corny niggas, nah, they not my type (My type)
Pump the breaks on 'em, like I ride bikes (Ride bikes)
Plus my shooter don't miss, he like Mike (Like Mike)
Fuck with the G's and 5, like my flight
Bye-bye, go night-night (Night-night, rrr)

Holiday, Holiday, slow that shit down!
Come on now, they done, they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done, two sticks in my bun
But, but first of all, when I say "two sticks in my bun"
I mean that, when I put a bun in my hair
Like, when I put my hair in a ponytail and I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
'Cause y'all, y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday, you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit
Now, you know, you gotta slow it down for them, you know?
Um, they wanna hear me sing
You know, behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly girl
There's a really sweet Harajuku Barbie, and, um
Now it's time for them to hear me get all nice and soft and moist
I mean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where
I just wanna be more, you know, delicate and wet (splash)
I'm, I'm, I'm so... I, I didn't mean to say that
I meant that, you know, Holiday, just slow it down, daddy!

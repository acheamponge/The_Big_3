[Intro]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Bitches ain't serious, man, these bitches delirious
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors
I just pick up and go; might pick up a ho
Might give conversation, if you kick up the dough
Never mind my money, never mind my stats
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks
Pink Friday, two milli; "Super Bass," triple plat'
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winnin'
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same
When I'm sittin' with Anna, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sittin' with Anna
Front row at Oscar de la Renta, posture
Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
Put these bitches on lock out, where the fuck is your roster?
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

[Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But, this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Yeah, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Verse 2]
7-Up went and gave my commercial to Cee-Lo
But don't tell them I said it, let's keep it on the D-low
If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost about six figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?
Flyin' spurs for hers, mean I'm fuckin' above it
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it Casper
But this shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I styling? I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waiting, 'cause them pictures will sell
Now don't you feel a-stupid, yeah, that's egg on yo' face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face

[Interlude]
Dick in your face
Put my dick in your face, yeah

[Chorus]
Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
Got the certification, 'cause it come with the stone
But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
Yeah, my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
It should come on a cone, it should come on a cone
'Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, dick in your face
Ooh-ooh, dick in your face
Ooh-ooh, dick in your face
Put my dick in your face
Put my dick in your face, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah

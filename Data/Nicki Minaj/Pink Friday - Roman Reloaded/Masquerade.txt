[Verse 1]
Feel, feel, feel the beat of the drum
Move like you really wanna be number one
You can, you can, you can beat out the comp
Run like you really wanna be at the top
Stop
Adrenaline rush, 'cause you have been identified as a hustler
Topic of discussion, but beat it like a percussioner
And chuck the deuce up, and tell 'em it's just love

[Refrain]
(Whoop, whoop)
Damn, diggity-dog
Let them bums stay mad, 'cause we livin' it up
(Whoop, whoop)
Shelltops is on
And I'm popping, like I'm popping, like I'm popping some corn

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, I don't wanna take you
If we fall down, don't get upset
And now is just the beginning
And we'll figure it out somehow

[Chorus]
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry-go-round
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry-go-round
Right now
It's something you create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now
Okay to make a mistake
Yeah, baby, this is your day
It's time to masquerade

[Verse 2]
Uh
Bass, the bass, feel the bass in your face
Hit the finish line, first place in the race
Yes, King Kong on your chest
Running, and I'm coming to baton to your left
Yup, you can be who you want
Be who you is, never be who you aren't
Never ever fold under pressure
Desperate times get desperate measure

[Refrain]
(Whoop, whoop)
Damn, diggity-dog
Let them bums stay mad, 'cause we livin' it up
(Whoop, whoop)
Shelltops is on
And I'm popping, like I'm popping, like I'm popping some corn

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, I don't wanna take you
If we fall down, don't get upset
And now is just the beginning
And we'll figure it out somehow

[Chorus]
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry-go-round
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry-go-round
Right now
It's something you create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now
Okay to make a mistake
Yeah, baby, this is your day
It's time to masquerade

[Bridge]
I'ma call you afro, 'cause you never ball
Fuck all you bitches, and I don't ever call
Next day, suck my teste
I ain't playing games, bitch, but checkmate, checkmate
Breaker 1-9, Br-Breaker 1-9, Br-Breaker 1-9
All my party people, lemme see you one time

[Chorus]
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry-go-round
Right now, masquerade
Master the merry-go-round
Right now
It's something you create
It's never ever too late
It's never ever too late
Right now
Okay to make a mistake
Yeah, baby, this is your day
It's time to masquerade
Right now

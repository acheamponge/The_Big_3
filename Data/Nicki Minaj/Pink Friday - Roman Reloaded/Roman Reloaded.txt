[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals
So I laugh at hopefuls; "Nicki pop!"
Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement, akh
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, is it me, or did I put these rap bitches on the map again?
You mad ’cause I’m at the Grammys with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelin’
Why they never bring you name up at the panel, then?
Hottest MCs, top five
You need money? I got mine
More knots than Eric on Basketball Wives
(Ya dig?)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ugh, I couldn’t do your TV show, I needed ten more mil'
Not ten on the back, I need ten on signin'
Give that shit to a wash-up, bitch, I’m winnin’
If I had a label I would never sign you, hoes
Take bitches to school, then I Columbine these hoes
I hear the slick shit, bitch, you washed
All you hoes cryin’—Christopher Bosh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Ayoow when I tell ‘em that it’s Barbie, bitch
Yes, I really do mean that it’s Barbie, bitch
Ask Mattel: they auctioned my Barbie, bitch
Raggedy Ann, could never be a Barbie, bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel, scrapin’
I’m out in LA at the Ice Age tapin’
I’m chillin’ at the top, I got ample time
Bite me—Apple sign, haha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang (HahaHA! Yeah!)

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Kush on my breath, cocaine on my tongue
Eat that pussy, make it numb, she can't feel herself cum
Got a body on my gun, fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly, smoke a blunt, that mean I'm a high roller
My ex wanna work it out, bitch, try yoga
Two hoes in the bed, tell them hoes, slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi
That's a Nicki-Ménage à trois, ha!
Tunechi

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Um, my shit so cold, man, it don't even stank-o
Destructive-ass nigga, watch me break the bank
Weezy F and the 'F' is for "Fill in the blank"
I say, shout out Mack Maine, backyard bully
And the weed purple like a black girl pussy
Word, middle finger on the trigger
Unh, so you know that mean "Fuck a nigga"

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang-bang

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Bang-bang, my bitch bang, she bang bang
Well that's 'cause my bitch is Nina Ross
A-and she bang, b-b-bang, bang bang
She go bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
We bang, bang-bang
Bang, b-b-b-bang, bang, bang, Blood gang!
Hey!

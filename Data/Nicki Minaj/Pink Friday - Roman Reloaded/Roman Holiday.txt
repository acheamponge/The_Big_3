[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Verse 1]
You done, you tight? You suck at life?
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice
Worship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these bitches couldn't wipe my ass
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari
I am the ultimate Svengali
You, you bitches can't even spell that
You, you hoes bugging, repel that
Let me tell you this, sister
I am, I am colder than a blister
'Cause my flow's so sick, and I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Verse 2]
Bitch, twitch!
Bitch, motherfucking right, this is World War Six
This right here might make a bitch die
And this right here is gonna make a bitch cry
And if we being honest, I am such a great guy
And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock
[stuttering]
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under
No them bitches ain't eating, they dying of hunger
Motherfucker, I me, who the fuck is this hoe?
And yes, maybe just a touch of Tourette's
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my beret

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Bridge]
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski

[Verse 3]
Talking 'bout me, you talking about me?
I dare a motherfucker to be talking about me
That bitch must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
They want the outline, I give them a goatee
Goddamn, motherfucker, you talking about me?
I dare a motherfucker to be talking about me
That bitch must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
A-buh-buh-buh now give then a goatee

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

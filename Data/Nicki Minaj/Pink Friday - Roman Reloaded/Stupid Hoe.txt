[Intro]
Uh, yaow, yaow

[Verse 1]
I get it cracking like a bad back
Bitch talking she the queen when she looking like a lab rat
I'm Angelina, you Jennifer
C'mon, bitch, you see, where Brad at?
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin' but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I'm rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back 'cause they know I'm the frontman
Put me on a dollar 'cause I'm who they trust in
Ayo SB, what the fuck's good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin' wood
Them nappy headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch would

[Chorus]
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe
Yeah, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
Yeah, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)

[Verse 2]
Uh, look Bubbles, go back to ya' habitat
MJ gone, and I ain't havin' that
How you gonna be the stunt double to the nigga monkey?
Top of that I'm in the Phantom lookin' hella chonky
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up in the Porsche, but it ain't de Rossi
Pretty bitches only could get in my posse
Yes, my name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey, yo Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP
Who's gassin' this hoe? BP?
Hmm... thinks
One, two, three, do the Nicki Minaj blink
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody

[Chorus]
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe
Yeah, you a, you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)
Yeah, you a, you a stupid hoe (You stupid, stupid)

[Verse 3]
If you cute, then your crew can roll
If you sexy, eat my cucka roll
Put ya' cape on, you a super hoe
2012, I'm at the Super Bowl

[Bridge]
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me then she coulda prolly came back
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me then she could've probably came back
You a stupid hoe, you a stupid hoe, you a stupid hoe
And I ain't hit that note, but fuck you stupid hoe, fuck you stupid hoe
I said fuck a stupid hoe and fuck a stupid hoe
I said fuck a stupid hoe and fuck a stupid hoe
I said fuck a stupid hoe and fuck a stupid hoe

[Outro]
I am the female Weezy

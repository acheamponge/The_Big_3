[Verse 1]
Hey, you, jump in this ride
It's real nice, it's slippery inside
Wise guy, come get this pie
R-r-ride it, ride it in style
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago
I drop it, I pick it up slow
I want it, I'm kicking it though
'Cause they know that I got that good shit
Said I'm bad, but I could be a good bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
We gon'

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger over there
I'm really liking the way you whip it, whip it
Yeah, I want you every day
You're so right (So right)
You're so tight (So tight)
You got my world spinnin'
You got my world spinnin'
My head goes round and around, r-round and around
And I'm thinking if we could be
Stranger, what you say?
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (Uh!)

[Drop]
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go

[Verse 2]
Woah
Is that my cue?
I'm lookin' for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2
My SAT scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag, I Louis Vuitton bagged him
Hopped out the jag, proceeded to shag-shagged him
Slim, trim, also light skin
So Pe-Pe-Peter put the pipe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
We gon'

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger over there
I'm really liking the way you whip it, whip it
Yeah, I want you every day
You're so right (So right)
You're so tight (So tight)
You got my world spinnin'
You got my world spinnin'
My head goes round and around, r-round and around
And I'm thinking if we could be
Stranger, what you say?
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (Uh!)

[Drop]
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go

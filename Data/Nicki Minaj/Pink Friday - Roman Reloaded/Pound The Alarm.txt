[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down
Uh!

[Verse 1]
Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own 'em?
Some call me Nicki, and some call me Roman
Skeeza, pleeza, I'm in Ibiza (Whoo)
Giuseppe Zanotti, my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy thatâ€™s all I do
If you need a bad bitch, let me call a few
Pumps on, and the little mini-skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'ma turn 'em out
Okay, bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, hey?
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go

[Pre-Chorus]
Music makes me high

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down

[Drop]
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

[Verse 2]
I wanna do it for the night, night
So, get me now, and knock this over
I wanna do it like you like, like
Come get me, baby
We're not getting younger
I just want you tonight, night
Baby, we won't do it for life, life

[Pre-Chorus]
Music makes me high

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down

[Drop]
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

[Breakdown]
Alarm!
Alarm!
Alarm!
Alarm!

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter, and hotter
Sexy, and hotter, let's shut it down

[Drop]
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

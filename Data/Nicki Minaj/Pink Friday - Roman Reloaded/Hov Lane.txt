[Verse 1]
Zippin', I’m zippin', I’m zippin'
Soon as they come out, I’m dippin'
Big ass closet, I’m trippin'
Big booty strippers, I’m tippin'
Big ass chain, I’m heavy
And it didn’t cost me a penny
They pay me to rock it
Damn, I got niggas in pocket
Super Bowl, Grammys
What a hell of a jammie!
All these bitches my sons
I’ma get ‘em a nanny
Argentina for Pepsi; Orlando All-Star
Fuck you said, bitch? Fuck you, pornstar
I don’t do shotgun, I be driving my own car
I don’t do shots neither, I’m buying the whole bar
Holy Moly, G copped me a Rolly
I ain't catchin' the puck, but iced out like a goalie, nigga

[Chorus]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train

[Verse 2]
I travel more than you walking with a basketball
I'm out in Spain, running game to the Matador
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my categor
You like a Rav 4; I’m like the Aventador
Birkin bags, man, I murk them ads
When I re-up on reloaded, I'ma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot; when I'm out, I'm spotted
They gone frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-N-Niggas on Banshees is speeding
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leaning
Damn, a bitch late for a meeting
NYPD comin’
Belt Parkway, we gunnin’
Double R engine hummin'
Acting a fool, we dumbin’

[Chorus]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train

[Bridge]
Nintendo and we in the end-zone
I don’t give a fuck, ho
Like we in the friend zone
What the fuck it look like?
What the fuck it’s hitting fo'?
Tell them bitches
"Y-y-y-y-you you ain’t about that life!"
Nintendo and we in the end-zone
I don’t give a fuck, ho
Like we in the friend zone
What the fuck it look like?
What the fuck it’s hitting fo'?
Tell them bitches
"Y-y-y-y-you you ain’t about that life!"

[Chorus]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-y-you, y-y-you? Soul Train

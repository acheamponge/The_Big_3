[Intro: Bobby V]
Yeah
Bobby V
Yeah
DJ, turn me up
Don't you turn this down, no, no

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I think I gave him a discrete name
He replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game
No ball, but peep game
He addicted to hustle, I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin', make a hell of a killin'
Don't I stunt on these bitches?
Man, I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em
When I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leavin' the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, enough said
Pull off in that thang, and it's blush red

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'ma take ya down
I'ma have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

[Verse 2: Bobby V]
So caught up in this girl
Shawty got me love trapped, now
Can't control myself, 'cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around
And when we doing, I can hear her make a sound
Shawty was singing like me
Had that girl singing, singing like me
She be like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
Oh, I, I ,I, I-I-I, I, I, I (Oh, whoa)
She looking at me like she want it
I'm over here (Oh, whoa)
She climbing on top of me
I'ma make her scream, her scream like

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'ma take ya down
I'ma have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, 'cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'ma take ya down
I'ma have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow
Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'ma take ya down
I'ma have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

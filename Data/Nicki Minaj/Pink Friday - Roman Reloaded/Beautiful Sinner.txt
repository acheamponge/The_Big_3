[Intro]
South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap career, and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
When mi did ah leave then take it down
True say mi come out of England and it done
True say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad, Trinidad, my island

[Verse 1]
I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

[Chorus]
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

[Verse 2]
I bet you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

[Chorus]
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

[Bridge]
Maybe you're the master of disguise
And you are puttin' on and you're really the saint, the good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are, then baby, take me now

[Chorus]
Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good (oh, I didn't know)
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

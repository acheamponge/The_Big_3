RedOne
Uh

[Verse 1]
Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get a wave
They say what they gonna say
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches, like me, is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more
'Til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

[Chorus]
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop...

[Post-Chorus]
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka

[Verse 2]
Jump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop
I own that
And I ain't payin' my rent this month
I owe that
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
Dancehall life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star
Now everybody let me hear you say ray, ray, ray
Now spend all your money, 'cause today payday
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

[Pre-Chorus]
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

[Chorus]
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop...

[Post-Chorus]
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka

[Chorus]
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop...

[Post-Chorus]
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka
We're higher than a motherfucka

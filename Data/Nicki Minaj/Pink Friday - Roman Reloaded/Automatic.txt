[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic

[Verse 1]
It's automatic, I'm a runaway train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'mma show you bizarre tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic, my condition's unknown
There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

[Verse 2]
It's automatic, some might call it insane
I assure you, I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be falling for me, boy
Yeah, just like a domino tonight tonight (ni-i-ight)
It's automatic when I'm rockin' the beat
Systematically, I'm droppin' your heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki so bad tonight, tonight (ni-i-ight)

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

[Bridge]
Press rewind, p-p-press rewind
It's automatic, I-I'm Einstein
I'm lookin' for that Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland
Scotland, I can idle in
South Africa and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill
Bri-ri-ri-ri-ring the bill
Br-bri-bri-bri-bring the bill
Bri-bri-bring the bill
Shut the club down
Bring the bill

[Chorus]
I can't control the way I'm movin' my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor, I can't quit
Now, I know, it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

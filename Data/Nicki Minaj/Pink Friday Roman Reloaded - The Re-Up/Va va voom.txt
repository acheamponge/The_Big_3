[Verse 1]
Just met a boy, just met a boy, when
He can come inside of my playpen
'Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So, I think that I'm going in for the taking
Hear through the grapevine that he's cakin'
We can shoot a movie, he can do the tapin'
Boom boom pow, this thing be shakin'
I ain't even tryna find out who he datin'

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them g-g-games
I'mma run away-ay, I'mma run away-ay-ay

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight, and let me do my dance
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom

[Verse 2]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He can become my little problem
'Cause it look like he modeling clothes in Dublin
So, I think he that getting that green, a goblin
Hear through the grapevine that he hang low
We can shoot a movie, we can bang like Rambo
Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he can understand my lingo

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them g-g-games
I'mma run away-ay, I'mma run away-ay-ay

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight, and let me do my dance
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom

[Bridge]
Boy, I'm in this club slow-mo
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you feeling me from the jump
I wanna ride too
You got that hot shit, boy, you blessed
Let me feel up on your chest
Flex it, you the man
You the man, one-hundred grand
The same old game, blow
Yes, I play it very well
Come baby, lay it down, let me stay down
Let me show you how I run things in my playground
Come, and get this va va voom voom (woo woo)

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight, and let me do my dance
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom

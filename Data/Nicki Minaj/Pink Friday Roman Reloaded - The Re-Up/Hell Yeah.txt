[Chorus: Parker Ighile]
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, yeah
I ain't see you on the Forbes yet
Swear to God, I ain't see you in the stores yet
Donatella on the corset
Pretty Gang, in the back of my Corvette
Copped my best friends Rangers and Benzes
Plus all my menses, Louie V lenses
This is how it feel, when you winnin'
Man, they been rocking with me since the beginning, inning
This is where the stress ends
Feel ill, when you never gotta stress ends
Always in the press when
Paparazzi in the bushes, with the stretch lens
Say cheese to that, pull up on the double R, pop clutch on them
No, them strippers ain't mad, when I touch on them
Russell Simmons shoe game, put a rush on them
Send a GT vodka, sitting on top of
Mafia money, eating seafood pasta
VMA's, I was good there, front row, yeah, always in a good chair
The bad gon' boo, but the good cheer, that's why my pockets on blimp, like the Good Year
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Parker Ighile]
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
But, you're boring as fuck though, why these bitches in the game so cutthroat?
Why they can't just let Young Nicki live? Why they gotta feel the wrath, to know Nicki is -
Not playing? Boss for real, when they go against The Kid, it's gon' cost for-real (Pharrell)
Came straight from the hood, with the cross appeal
That's why these big names, wanna toss the deal
Okay, I'll take it, sign on the dotted line, but I'm quick to check a bitch if she outta line
Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel, why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol, huh?
Say cheese to that, when they see me on the screen, check E! for that
Bitches lying on the kid, I won't leave for that, intimidated by my aura, where Rita at?
Send a GT vodka, in a helicopter, me and my Japanese bitches
In Osaka
BET, I was good there, front row, yeah, always in a good chair
Why the fuck would I leave, when I'm good here?
Let me send a Twitpic of my good hair, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Parker Ighile]
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah
What we do when we go high?
We doing it all night
Ooh the girls, they wanna vibe with us tonight
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up
Screaming hell yeah, hell yeah

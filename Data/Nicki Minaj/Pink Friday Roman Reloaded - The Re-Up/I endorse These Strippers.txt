[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Did I endorse young Mitt, I am young Nick
Your panties all in a bunch, well, you can suck my dick
All these chicks is ridiculous
Conversations is frivolous
Man, fuck all these bitches
I am a polygamist
Playing with my pussy
I am just that bored
I mean we could've went shopping
But what could you afford?
I bust a band in the VIP
My money can't fit in clips
I tell the hoes when they strip
That they could play with my clit
Oooh, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, lotta boobs
Man, I make the baddest bitches send me nudes
I ain't got no time for your silly feuds
I'm with pretty gang at Sue's, rendezvous
Batman, I'm robbing hoes
I tell them bitches yo, v√°manos
These hoes my sons, I'm papa though
I feed them bitches wit papa dough
I'm tropical, you comical
Bitch, read my muthafuckin' chronicle
You my son, son, prodigal
And you adopted, not even biological

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Hey bitch, I'm T-Raw
Get on that pole and free fall
Heard my best friend fucked with you
I said, "That's cool, now you do too."
Gettin' head in the carpool
Her mouth draw like art school
Anaconda, part two
I pull it out, that's all you, all you
I'm tryna smash, I got the cash, she got the ass
Now tell your friends I'm a lil nigga wit a big one, ain't tryna brag
I'm Eli in that strip club, that money, got a quarter back
I make a hike, go long, first down, that's 10 racks
She said I can't fuck for free
I told her that's cool by me
Said I can't fuck for free
She gon' probably have to pay me
Gettin dizzy all I do is spin
White ghost I'm floatin'
She up and down that pole
But she ain't votin'

[Verse 3: Brinx]
Now I endorse this paper, I endorse this liquor
I bust a band in the VIP and I support these strippers
She bust it down to a split, she got a horse ass with her
She tryna bring home a friend and I enforce that nigga
I threw like 4 stacks nigga and then 4 more stacks nigga
I'm only just gettin' started, I blew a porsche that minute
It's king of diamonds so starless onyx, my whore got bitter
'Cause I ain't come home this morning, she almost torched my shit
When I hit a shopping spree oh shit I ball
Sorry but you can't get these at Lenox mall
Nah ho, this ain't clearance at americana
This that boy you better cuff ya baby mama
Copy, kinko, for Nicki show that pink hole
Drop it bust it open on the head, Ochocinco
I support these ratchet bitches and I treat 'em right
She fucked me to get to Nicki, that's that shit I like

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, "What you doin', Nicki?" Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

[Chorus: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Outro: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]
Going up in flames
Going up in flames

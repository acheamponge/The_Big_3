[Verse 1]
I drove for miles just to find you and find myself
All these screams, all these voices in my head
You gave me strength, gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

[Chorus]
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up

[Verse 2]
It's not your fault, I'm a bitch, I'm a monster
Yes, I'm a beast, and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these riches
I came this way, all this way just to say, ayy

[Chorus]
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up
Givin' up

[Bridge]
I'm givin' up baby, yes
I'm givin' up, baby
It feels like I've been drivin' for miles (Yeah)
I'm givin' up, baby
And I can't seem to silence these voices in my head (Yeah)
This time, won't you save me?
Come save me
This time, won't you save me?
Come save me

[Chorus]
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up (Givin' up)
Givin' up

[Intro: Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid-ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill, right?
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'ma just do me when it feel right
Uh, you could bring it any day
Natural bad-ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang-bang the pistol
A-a-and I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn, the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (Oh)
Last chance (Oh)
Yeah, this is my last chance
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (Uh huh)
I'm ready to shoot (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screamin' high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (This is my last chance)
Last chance (Oh yeah, yeah)
Yeah, this is my last chance (My last chance)
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (Ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj, Natasha Bedingfield & Both]
All the days of my life, I have been waiting for this time (Oh)
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes?
Anybody tryna stop me better not fuck with me this time (Oh)
Shoot, I am ready to shoot into the sky

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (This is your last chance)
Last chance (Oh)
Yeah, this is my last chance
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I'm ready to shoot

[Outro: Natasha Bedingfield & Nicki Minaj]
Only one chance, one bullet in the gun (I'm ready to shoot)
This is my life and I only got one, yeah (I'm ready to shoot)
Running through there and I put on the stars (I'm ready to shoot)
Oh, stick 'em up, stick 'em up now, yeah (I'm ready to shoot)
Only one chance, one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
The safety's off and I put it on the stars
Oh, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, uh
I'm ready to shoot
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to shoot
This is my life and I only got one, yeah
The safety's off and I put it on the stars
Get ready, ha
I'm ready to shoot

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This one is for the boys with the boomin' system
Top down, AC with the cooler system
When he come up in the club, he be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck like he savin' up
And he ill, he real, he might gotta deal
He pop bottles and he got the right kind of build
He cold, he dope, he might sell coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach
He a mothafuckin trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When he make it drip, drip, kiss him on the lip, lip
That's the kinda dude I was lookin' for
And yes, you'll get slapped if you're lookin', ho
I said, excuse me, you're a hell of a guy
I mean, my, my, my, my, you're like pelican fly
I mean, you're so shy and I'm loving your tie
You're like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Yes, I did, yes, I did
Somebody please tell em who the F I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up and chuck the deuce up

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Ester Dean]
Boy, you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Beatin' like a drum and it's comin' your way

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
This one is for the boys in the polos
Entrepreneur niggas and the moguls
He could ball with the crew, he could solo
But I think I like him better when he dolo
And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain't even gotta try to put the mack on
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look
Then the panties comin' off, off, uh
Excuse me, you're a hell of a guy
You know, I really got a thing for American guys
I mean, sigh, sickenin' eyes
I can tell that you're in touch with your feminine side, uh

Yes, I did, yes, I did
Somebody please tell 'em who the F I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up and chuck the deuce up

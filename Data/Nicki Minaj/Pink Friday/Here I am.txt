[Verse 1]
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Pre-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Chorus]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

[Post-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Bridge]
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar (Here I am)

[Outro]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

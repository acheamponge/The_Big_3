[Chorus: The Big Pink & Nicki Minaj]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Uh-huh)
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, ayo, ayo)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'ma need sixty-nine real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way, but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews
Every other city, it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties
I got the key to every muhfuckin' city (Kyuh)

[Chorus: The Big Pink, Nicki Minaj]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, yo)
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (Yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, so when I'm in the hills, I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami, I'm with Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe
And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva, then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see M.I.A
Superhero by night, r-r-rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk, I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch, Angelina Jolie (Ooh)
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her 'cause she get the mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway, yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strangé
I'm out in Paris, motherfucker, with Beyoncé

[Chorus: The Big Pink]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Girls, girls, every day, from London, Canada, and the USA
Girls, girls, every day, from London, Canada, and the USA
Girls, girls, every day, from London, Canada, and the USA
Girls, girls, every day, from London, Canada, and the USA
Where my Westside girls at? (Girls at)
And where my Eastside girls at? (Girls at)
Yo, where my Northside girls at? (Girls at)
And where my down-south girls at? (Girls at)
Yo, where my Westside girls at? (Girls at)
Yo, where my Eastside girls at? (Girls at)
Where my up-north girls at? (Girls at)
Now where my down-south girls at?

[Chorus: The Big Pink]
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes

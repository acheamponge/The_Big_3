[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't play with silly girls
All I know is the material girls
Give me the muny, the cars, the caseloads
The mun-mun-muny, the yen and the pesos

[Chorus]
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-mun-mun-muny

[Verse 1]
Told y'all on Drake's shit, told y'all to fixate
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape (Oh)
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation
Top five tax bracket in the population
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why
I ain't gotta wonder if I want to lease or buy
And I dictate how I'm gon' piece the pie
I ain't talkin' about no mothafuckin' pizza pie
'Cause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans
Nah, homie, you gon' need a bigger cock-pit
'Cause when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit

[Break]
Ayo, Captain, ayo, Cap
I-I don't wanna hear that navigation, big pa
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to get some sleep, ya dig?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't play with silly girls
All I know is the material girls
Give me the muny, the cars, the caseloads
The mun-mun-muny, the yen and the pesos

[Chorus]
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-mun-mun-muny

[Verse 2]
I'm in the UK, but just for one day
Who's to say I won't come back again?
Materialistic, I'm narcissistic
My shoe game is mean, it's so sadistic
I took the Learet to cop some lipstick
Yeah, I'ma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip on Rosé, you sip your Mystic
My flow's a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators
Balenciagas and they gotta be the Gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson
I'm on the bike, doin' wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin'
Gucci bag, just to put the coke cans in

[Break]
Hey, yo, Anna, hey, yo, Anna Wintour
I'ma need that cover, baby girl
It's Pink Friday, ya dig?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't play with silly girls
All I know is the material girls
Give me the muny, the cars, the caseloads
The mun-mun-muny, the yen and the pesos

[Chorus]
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-muny, yen and the pesos
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny
The mun-mun-mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-mun-mun-muny

[Bridge]
Material, I’m always on that new shit
Material, this shit is exclusive
Material, material world for material girls (Girls, girls, girls)
Material, don't ever get the truth bent
Material, I could give you the blueprint
Material, material world for material girls (Girls, girls, girls)

[Outro]
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material girls (Girls, girls, girls)
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material
Material, material, ma-ma-material girls

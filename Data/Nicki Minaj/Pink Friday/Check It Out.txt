[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
St-st-step up in the party like my name was "That Bitch"
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a fuckin' savage
Haters, you could kill yourself (Ah)
In my space shuttle and I'm not comin' down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes, it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't comin' back this time

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]
I can't believe it, it's so amazin'
This club is heated, this party's blazin'
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin'
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

[Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am]
Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ch-check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
St-st-step up in the party like my name is Mr. T
All these hating naggers ain't got nat'in' on me
Honestly, I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you Wiki Willy, you get super OG
Honeys always rush me 'cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies, they can't touch me 'cause I'm floatin' sky high
I stay niggarific, you don't need to ask why
You just gotta see with your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]
I can't believe it, it's so amazin'
This club is heated, this party's blazin'
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin'
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

[Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am]
Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ch-check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out

[Interlude: will.i.am]
Check this motherfucker out
It got me in the club, in the club just rocking like this
Oh, oh

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Da-dun-dun
The sun done, yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
Da-dun-dun, yep, in London
Competition? Why, yes, I would love some
How the fuck they get mad 'cause their run done?
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' money in abundance?
Man, I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffel bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest, fuck my nemesis
Exclamation, just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize 'cause you a simple bitch
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple shit
And put the iron to your face, you old wrinkled bitch

[Interlude: will.i.am]
This is mega nigga, u-u-ultra enigmatic
-Matic, -matic, -matic, -ma-ma-matic

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio, hotter than a skillet
We in the club, makin' party people holla
Money in the bank, we be gettin' top dollar
I'm a big baller, you a lil smaller
Step up to my level, need to grow a lil taller
I'm a shot caller, get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua, I'm a Rottweiler

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]
I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (Yeah)
This club is heated, this beat is bangin' (Yeah)
I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (Yeah)
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

[Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am]
Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ch-check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out

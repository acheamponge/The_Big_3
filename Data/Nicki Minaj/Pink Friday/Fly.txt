[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win (J.R.), to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

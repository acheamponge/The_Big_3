[Intro]
(Bangladesh)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Shitted on 'em
Man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
All these bitches is my sons
And I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em (Pss)
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals, I might break you off
And we ain't making up, I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Safaree]
(That was a earthquake, bitch), shitted on 'em
(You felt the ground shake, right?), man, I just shitted on 'em
(You bitches ain't fucking with her), shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em (You must've, ah)
(You must've lost your fuckin' mind), shitted on 'em
(You must've bumped your fuckin' head), man, I just shitted on 'em
(You crazy, stupid, ugly, monkey-looking bitches), shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em (Uh, yo, ah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
This stone is flawless, F1
I keep shooters up top in the F1
A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to F one
But I'ma eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Throw some fresh ones
More talent in my motherfuckin' left thumb
She ain't a Nicki fan, then the bitch deaf, dumb
You ain't my son, you my motherfuckin' step-son

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Safaree]
(I don't know what layaway look like), shitted on 'em
(Bitch, I can't even spell "welfare"), man, I just shitted on 'em
(You got me mistaken with your mother, ho), shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em (You bitches at the bottom of the totem pole)
(We at the top, bitch, she flopped), shitted on 'em
(Louis Vuitton everything, bitch), man, I just shitted on 'em
(Gucci, we don't fuck with it, it's too cheap, motherfucker), shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em (You bitches, ah, man)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
All these bitches is my sons
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Phoenix
Bitch, I get money, so I dos what I pleases
I live where the motherfuckin' pools and the trees is
Broke bitches so crusty (Disgust me)
Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff'-B
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me, ew
I'm the terminator
Bitch talk slick, I'ma have to terminate her
These little nappy-headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I'll spray you with the germinator (Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh)
Move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know the queen could use a back rub (Ah)
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used to be here, now you're gone, Nair

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Safaree]
(You nappy-headed son of a bitches), shitted on 'em
(I'ma start throwing Just for Me perm at your heads), man, I just shitted on 'em
(I'ma get the kid version), shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em (The kid version, 'cause you're a bunch of kids)
(Bunch of lil' nappy-headed hoes runnin' around, yeah), shitted on 'em
(Just for Me), man, I just shitted on 'em
(You know it, yeah, ho, you know it), shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em (Just for Me perm in your head when we see you, ow)

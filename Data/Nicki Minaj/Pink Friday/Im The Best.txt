[Intro]
Uh
Yo
Yo

[Verse 1]
It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, "Which world tour should I go on today?"
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Bridge]
It's okay, it's okay
Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best, best, best

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me (I hope they comin' for me)
Because the top is lonely ('Cause the top is lonely)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best

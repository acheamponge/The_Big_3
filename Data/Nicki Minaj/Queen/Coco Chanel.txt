[Intro: Foxy Brown & Boonk Gang]
Whole lotta gang shit
Beatzz
Oh, uh, ugh, ayo, Chun, uh, ayo, Chun
We back on that Coco shit, nigga, number one, uh
Whole lotta gang shit
Haha, every bitch bloodclaat, girl
Oh, ayo, uh, Brooklyn!
Kick for my stomach, let's go!

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, llevame a la coco, yeah a la a coco
Ellos quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke hoe, don’t fuck with po-po
Numero uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things and let them things fling
Niggas know my name ring, and it go "ding-ding"
If I get a inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin’ 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, if I'm in the Gurkha, then they in the back of it
If I tell 'em eat food, then they make a snack of it
If they take your cocaine, then they making crack of it
If they yap your gold chain, then they make a plaque of it
No, we never lack on it, run up with the MAC on it
Put a couple racks on it, they gon' put the whack on it
She got the Nicki bundles, word to Stack on it
That's word to Brooknam, that's word to Bucktown
That’s word to Harlem World, shout out to uptown
You know I shine on ’em, I spray sheen on 'em
That’s word to Southside, Jamaica, Queens on 'em
I'm mad Queens on 'em, runn mad schemes on ’em
I never scale back, the triple beams on 'em
My ice gleams on 'em, Wu-Tang creams on 'em
I pull up on the block bumpin' Biggie "Dreams" on 'em (Woop)
Hunnit degrees on 'em, but I freeze on 'em
A light breeze on 'em, I might breeze on 'em
Might do it like it's Christmas and light trees on 'em
I see the copycats bitin' my steez on 'em

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, llevame a la coco, yeah a la a coco
Ellos quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke hoe, don't fuck with po-po
Numero uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things and let them things fling
Niggas know my name ring, and it go "ding-ding"
If I get a inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown & Nicki Minaj]
Gimme some bloodclaat, gunshot

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, llevame a la coco, yeah a la a coco

Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Foxy Brown]
Foxy plus one, it's me, young Chun
And we ah-guh fuck up the place and done
So tell 'em run, come and bring a lump sum
Ayo Fox, they don't make us or break us, word to young guns
Put your hands up
Illest to ever do it, tell' em Fe recognize
Unuh Kartel, dem fi free up Vybz?
They call me Ms. Bitch, but I don't miss, bitch
Got real shooters, better D up, guys
Who me? I'm physically fine
Who she? Inside we know she dyin'
Bitch ain't see Billboard in 2017
Had to drop Queen on 'em like a guillotine
All these jealous bitches on the jelly team
Keepin' it a hundred, that's a jelly bean
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh (Mhm, mhm, ayy, ayy)
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh (Ihh, ihh, ayy, ayy)

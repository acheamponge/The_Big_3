[Intro: Future]
Damn, damn, damn right
Huh? Pluto! Yeah

All this green, sir
Rollin' weed, sir
Big ol' racks, sir

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, headline tours, sir, with a band, sir
I ain't pressed, sir, over a band, sir
Get her a ticket, sir, she's a fan, sir
Can't keep her man off my Instagram, sir
New slaves, but I'm still the master
I'm whippin' foreigns to make 'em go faster
Miss Aretha, I think I just passed her
Icy Patek, tell 'em, "Kiss my ass, sir"
Pretty gang, sir, pretty gangster
Said she was better than me, what a prankster
He said, "You bad, Nicki," I said, "Thanks, sir"
Stay in some fresh prints, Ashley Banks, sir
Call me A.I., sir, I'm The Answer
I'm in the playoffs, sir, I advance, sir
These niggas broke, they ain't got no plans, sir
I call 'em Sway, they ain't got the answer
Ass shots, sir, with no chaser
Pretty titties all up in his face, sir
They double tap, sir, it's a fact, sir
All the comments sayin', "It's a snack," sir
New bae, I'm his dirty dancer
I said I wouldn't, but I took a chance, sir
Ride him like a sled, Dasher, Prancer
I bust it open for him out in Cannes, sir
If I don't ball, sir, I'll have a drought, sir
Them bum bitches ain't allowed, sir
Yeah, NickiHndrxx (Brrr)

[Chorus: Future]
On the gas, sir, on the gas, sir
Splurgin' cash, sir, blowin' cash, sir
Fuckin' hoes, sir, fuckin' hoes, sir
Ridin' foreigns, sir, ridin' foreigns, sir
Dirty Fanta, sir, dirty Fanta, sir
Hot Atlanta, sir, Hot Atlanta, sir
Cockin' hammers, sir, cockin' hammers, sir
'Scuse my manners, sir, excuse my manners, sir

[Verse 2: Future]
Automatic, sir, my bitch the baddest, sir (Bitch bad)
I'm livin' lavish, sir, fuck all the static, sir (Fuck all the static)
Out on bond service, servin' dope, sir (Sir)
Where I'm from, sir, they'll serve your mom, sir (Serve your mom, sir)
Cocaina dealin', jackboy, sir (Jackboy)
Stars in the ceilin', sir, dope in the attic, sir (Sir, dope)
Tarzan, sir, I drive fast, sir (Drive fast, sir)
Jeff Gordon sir, NASCAR, sir (Pew!)
Pluto my first name, Cash last name, sir (Yeah, sir)
He wanna body, sir, you tryna get some stains, sir

[Chorus: Future]
On the gas, sir, on the gas, sir
Splurgin' cash, sir, blowin' cash, sir
Fuckin' hoes, sir, fuckin' hoes, sir
Ridin' foreigns, sir, ridin' foreigns, sir
Dirty Fanta, sir, dirty Fanta, sir
Hot Atlanta, sir, Hot Atlanta, sir

[Outro: Future & Nicki Minaj]
Cockin' hammers, sir, cockin' hammers, sir
If I don't ball, sir, I'll have a drought, sir
Them bum bitches ain't allowed, sir
(Excuse my manners, sir, excuse my manners, sir)

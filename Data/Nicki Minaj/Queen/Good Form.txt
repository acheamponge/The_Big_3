[Intro]
Eardrummers
Mhm, uh-huh, uh-huh
Mhm, yo, hold up, hold up
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1]
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad bitch coming through, yo, what's the hold up?
I'm in that new new, me and New New when I roll up
I tell the valet, "Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up"
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (Go!)

[Refrain]
'Cause I be the baddie, B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach
(Come on!)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom (Nah)
See, I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

[Chorus]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

[Verse 2]
I slick, slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say, "Kiss, kiss"
I'm in that new new De La Renta, channeling Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, run me the money (Go!)

[Refrain]
'Cause I be the baddie, B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach
(Come on!)

[Pre-Chorus]
See a bitch get more press than a key pad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See, I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

[Chorus]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

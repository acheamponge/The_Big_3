[Verse 1]
Don't be goofy, bring some passion to the table, what you doin'?
Don't be stupid, I'm the realest bitch you know, yeah, I'm the truest (True, true, true)
When you pull up, gotta pull up on me like you already knew it (Mmm, already knew it)
Yeah, you keep saying you the truth, well, nigga, you gon' have to prove it (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't never put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' some body
So, I don't ever put my trust in nobody

[Chorus]
Who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

[Verse 2]
Don't be jealous, put some trust inside your text when you be textin' (Mmm, textin')
Tell the truth when you get tired of me askin' all them questions (Askin' all them questions)
I prayed to God for peace and love, I'm lookin' at you as a blessing (Bless up, bless up, bless up, yeah)
You told me life been lookin' up, so take that past shit as a lesson (Oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't never put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' some body
So, I don't ever put my trust in nobody

[Chorus]
But who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

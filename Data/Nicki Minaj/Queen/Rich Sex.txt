[Intro: Nicki Minaj, Brinx Billions & Lil Wayne]
Full blown, run rich, Brinx
Yo, Mula, yo, yeah
Ayo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I know what these niggas like, and it ain't my charm
I ain't stupid, this $250 on my arm
I like money more than dick, nigga, that's a fact
You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch nigga?
I'ma help him fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it poppin', put me on your wishlist
Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He said, "Baby, everyday we ballin'," I say, "Swish, swish"
Got him callin' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, "Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga, B.I.G.'s bitch"
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Lil mama said she only fuckin' on a rich dick
I cum in her face and tell her, "Now you lookin' rich, bitch"
Her friend in the other room, can I get a witness?
We could have some rich sex, cannot have no rich kids
Facts, all my bitches have no limits
Fucked her in a helicopter, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in a drop top, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with, now she screamin', "Why I'm with him?"
Damn, lil mama said she only suckin' on a rich dick
Make you put your money where your mouth at, that's some lipstick
Let's fuck on the money 'fore we count that, that's some rich shit
Pussy smell like money when I'm down there, that some Nic shit
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Rich who? Got bricks, too
The rich get richer, that's my ritual
Rich crew, link my bitch, too
Mack took the Wraith, me and Tune flew

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Brinx Billions]
I don't even know where we going these days, where we landing
Queen, where we going again?
To the moon, Alice, the goon palace
We don't get fly, we take flight, haha
Woo! Haha, ahh-haha, ahh!
You mad, doggie? You mad, doggie? Haha
(Next stop: New York)
Hahaha, rrrrr!

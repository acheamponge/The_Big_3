[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ear Drummers
Mhm, Young Money, uh huh, mhm
Yo, hold up, hold up, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad bitch coming through, yo, what's the hold up?
I'm in that new new, me and New New when I roll up
I tell the valet, "Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up"
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (Go!)

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach
(Come on!)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
See, a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom
See, I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like, ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I slick, slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches, we all say, "Kiss, kiss"
I'm in that new new De La Renta, channeling Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, run me the money (Go!)

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach
(Come on!)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
See, a bitch get more press than a keypad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See, I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie, he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie, he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Barbie, (Yes?) I think you gnarly (Ooh)
I think you fly, these other bitches just larvae (Haha)
When you make that ass jump like my heartbeat
And if you let me eat the pussy, then it's shark week
"Hello, may I speak to Tunechi?" May I ask who's callin'?
Everybody got the juice without a glass to pour it
I want my cake and eat it, too, and after that, I'm starving
I feel like Adam, but I'm 'bout to eat a apple on you, uh
Rollie on the right side, now y'all on my time
Please get off my dick before it turn into a pipe bomb
Eyes lookin' like I'm somewhere outta Taiwan
Faded as fuck as always, hi mom
Look dude, I'll stomp your ass out in my good shoes
Be my foot stool
Told my lawyer don't call me 'less it's good news
Then my phone started ringing off the hook, snooze, brrr

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]
'Cause I be the baddie, B
Young Money, it's a army
He ain't into toys, but he fuck with the Barbie
It's the president, Monica what they call me
Nicki the ninja, Nicki the boss, Nicki the harajuku, ah
Remix, baby
Mula
Yeah, yeah, yeah

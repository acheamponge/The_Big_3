[Intro: Kodak Black]
I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest
Mortal Kombat, ninja Nicki, who ya pick is?

[Interlude: Patty Duke]
Ayo, queen, got the customers out here, man
They lovin' this shit, man, they lovin' this shit, man
Where you at, man? Where you at, man?
We need you here, man, I know you in Miami

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, you could take all of my bitches out to Abu Dhabi
Let one of my besties confiscate your Maserati
You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we fuck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry
You could call me Barbie, 'cause I look just like a dolly
Yes, I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to Polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace, this the Queen’s like it’s Hollis
Put 15 million dollars, on it, ask LL, I'm doin' it
Don't get cute and ruin it, all my skill, I hone it
I pity opponents, it look easy don't it
(It look easy don't it, it look easy don't it)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

[Outro: Patty Duke]
Yo, Nick, what's good? This ya boy Patty Duke
Man, you already know we got shit movin' out here, man
That these bitches ain't fuckin' wit' you
They ain't fuckin' wit' the team, man, all of 'em, man
'Cause niggas know that bag heavy, boy, that bag heavy
Niggas get fuckin' dropped 'round here
Queens get the money, man
Never fakin' it, always makin' it, ya heard?
Iconic shit, man

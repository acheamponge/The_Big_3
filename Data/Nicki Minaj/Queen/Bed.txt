[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit’ your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Thousand dollar sheets
Waitin’ for you on some thousand dollar sheets
I got Carter III on repeat
Back shots to the beat of "A Milli" on you
Got me acting like you got a milli on you
He say I'm the GOAT, yeah, the billy on you
I could make all your dreams come true
Wanna fall through, then you better come through

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
But don't make me wait until the morning

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed wit’ your name on it
Wit’ your name on it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Strawberry lingerie
Waitin' for you, strawberries, lingerie
You told me you on the way
Mess around, mess around, put it down on you
I’ma do everything I said I'm gon' do
Pretty little body, it look better on you
Might have to blow it like a feather on you
Waterfalls, ooh, yeah, you better come through

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
But don't make me wait until the morning

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Got a bed wit’ your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed wit' your name on it (Oh, yeah)
Wit' your name on it (On it)

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande]
O-on, on it (On it)
O-on, on it
O-on, on it
O-on, on it (But I put your name on it)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he in my startin' five, he get his city live
These niggas scared, they doing 50 in a 55
I'm tryna clap him like somebody told him, "Gimme five"
I'ma be a half an hour, but I told him, "Gimme five"
I'm tryna dance on him, blow my advance on 'em
I like him better when he got some sweatpants on him
I like his hang time, he said his head right
I said go all the way down and then head right
I watch him fuck it up, look at him luckin' up
I said, "You need some thick skin, baby, suck it up"
He go insane on it, I put my fame on it
Coulda put ZAYN on it, but I put your name on it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it, yeah
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down (Turn it down, baby)
Got a bed wit' your name on it (Your name)
Wit' your name on it

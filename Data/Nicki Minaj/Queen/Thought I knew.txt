[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I-I thought I knew you
Ha-ha-ha, I guess I didn't
I-I-I-I thought I knew you
Fuck, baby, I-I guess I didn’t
I-I-I thought you was down for real
Thought you would stick around for real
Ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Misconstrued your love (Misconstrued your love)
You confused my love
You givin' up (Up) on love (On love)
Not to lose my love (Not to lose my love), yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nicki Minaj]
Honestly, I think this shit excites you
You love drama, it excites you
I-I liked you
I-I-I-I don't think I’m talkin' to the right you

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & The Weeknd]
I-I-I-I thought I knew you (Thought I knew you, girl)
Ha-ha-ha I guess I didn't
I-I-I-I thought I knew you (Thought I knew you)
Fuck, baby, I guess I didn't
I-I-I thought you was down for real (Down for real)
Thought you would stick around for real (For real)
Ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Tell me why you let me come inside for real
Nevermind, you were never mine for real
Hit my line, I'ma hit decline for real
I ain't tryin' for a second time for real

[Pre-Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
Honestly, I think this shit excites you (Excites you)
All that drama that you're tied to (Ooh yeah)
You play the victim every time, too (Oh, whoa)
That shit came back and hit you times two

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & The Weeknd]
I-I-I-I thought I knew you (Thought I knew ya, baby)
Ha-ha-ha I guess I didn’t (Guess I didn’t, girl)
I-I-I-I thought I knew you (Oh, yeah)
Fuck, baby, I guess I didn't
I-I-I thought you was down for real (Down for real)
Thought you would stick around for real (’Round for real)
Ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah

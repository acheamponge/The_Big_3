[Verse]
I said I'm cool on it, baby, yeah, I'm straight
You say it's love, I don't it want it, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
You do too much, too little, yeah, too late

[Chorus]
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, I'm cool on it, I'm straight

[Outro]
You shoulda been listenin', listenin' in
Too busy glistenin', glistenin' in
Why you ain't listen then, listen back then?
Now you're too much, too little, yeah, too late

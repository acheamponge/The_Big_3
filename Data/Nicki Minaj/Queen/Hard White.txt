Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

[Verse 1]
Ayo, just last week I told 'em to pick a side
I bust shots, don't duck if it don't apply
Bae out in Paris, he told me to pick a ride
Sike, made you look, I still didn't pick a guy
I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
Me, Olivier, Jourdan Dunn, my baby, Winnie
Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarrassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest?
You the motherfucking fairest, Nicki
What I drop on this watch?
I don't know, about a hundred-fifty
I'm who they wishin' to be
These hoes is on the 'Gram, Nicki pitchin' a ki'
'Bout to cop Neverland, Michael up in the tree
You got bars and still broke? You might as well took a plea, uh
Be in the bando or would you rather move weight, Don Pablo? Uh

[Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

[Verse 2]
Ayo, just last week I told 'em they run done
My legacy could never be undone
I'm a prodigy, R.I.P Thun-Thun
Got these bitches shook, they shocked, no stun-gun
I'm the billy, billy goat, the GOAT, the GOAT's here
Vintage Herm√®s by Jean Paul Gaultier
Lagerfeld customize my gold chair
I run the point, you bitches just go cheer
Uh, look at my knockoffs, I told 'em knock it off
Anything that Nicki do, you know they knock it off
Put my crown on again, and I'ma knock it off
Anything with Nicki in it, they gon' pocket off
I mean profit off, my plug drop it off
You see them copyin' my hair, tell 'em, "Chop it off"
Uh, bad gyal whip, the top is off
You nuh see him downgrade when mi drop 'em off
Uh, I ain't never play the ho position
I ain't ever have to strip to get the pole position
Hoes is dissin'? Okay, these hoes is wishin'
You're in no position to come for O's position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position

[Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

[Outro]
W-w-w-w-w-work hard
W-w-w-w-w-work hard
J-j-just last week, I told 'em to pick a side
I-I-I bust shots, don't duck if they don't apply

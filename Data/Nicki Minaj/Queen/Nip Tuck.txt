[Intro]
Gave you everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (Take it all back, hey)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you (Yeah, brr)
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 1]
Mmm, see, I used to curve niggas like you
Skrr, skrr, swerve niggas like you
Even though I heard what you might do
I didn't get concerned 'cause I liked you
But no, no, I can't hide who you are
I can't lie, it's too hard (So hard, so hard)
I need more than what you got from me
You want a bad bitch and new cars

[Chorus]
And I gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (Take it all, take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that’s on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 2]
I know how to flip niggas like you
I get petty and clip niggas like you
Fuck around and forget niggas like you
Promise I could never miss niggas like you
Said no, no
Feelings fading away, I can't hear what you say
I need more than what you got for me
You got a bad bitch who won't stay

[Chorus]
And I gave you everything, yeah
You gon' need to take it all back (Take it all, take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 3]
Yo, give up on 'em, I don't even wanna get up on 'em
And I ain't tryna work it out
But I'm at the gym on a mat doin' sit-ups on 'em
You let yourself go, you don't represent O’
So trust me, just go
You settle for less, yo, you disrespectful
You was special, the new you just dull
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come off my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that edible
Which means them bags stacked high
You ain't got the drive, my nigga ya pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, every day, a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'bout your mattresses
But um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must've thought I did
I should have copped the stick, but I'm teflon
Pressed on, headstrong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If his word bond and he wanna sex icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you was, tryna stunt on Nick?
Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets, nigga
'Cause a true bad bitch ain't weak or bitter

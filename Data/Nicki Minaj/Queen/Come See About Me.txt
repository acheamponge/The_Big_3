[Verse 1]
Come, come see what I've been up to
Come, come see about me
I know you had a lot of work to do
Ooh, you got used to things without me, baby
Yeah, you got used to every thing I never did
You got sick of being sick of all my flaws
You got over all the pain I ever caused
And I didn't mean it, no, but-

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
So please don't try to deny me of that, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
See, baby, ooh you know I need you to-

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
I'm doing good, boy, I'm up where we belong at
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong at
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be
So come see about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Want you to see how much I changed up
Ooh, I just hope I'm not too late
I know you're hesitant about it, but-
I got a lot I wanna say to you
Hate that I could never measure up
Hate that I could never be the one you needed
'Cause now I'm the one who needs you, but, baby-

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you canâ€™t fake it
So please don't try to deny me of that, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
See, baby, ooh you know I need you to-

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me (Right here)
Come, come see about me (Right here)
I'm doing good, boy, I'm up where we belong at
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong at
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be
So come see about me, yeah

[Bridge]
About me, about me, about me, about me
About me, about me, about me, about me
About me, about me, about me, about me
About me, about me. about me, about me

[Chorus]
Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
I'm doing good, boy, I'm up where we belong at
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong at
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be
So come see about me, yeah
